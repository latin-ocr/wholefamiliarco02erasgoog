that every man must live hy his trade. Ha. A very honourable trade
indeed, to burn houses, rob charchae, ravish nune, plunder the poor, and
“ murder the innocent! Thr. Butchers are hired to kill beasts; and
why is our trade found fault with, who are hired to kill monl '

Ha. But were you never thoughtful what should become ol' your
soul if you happened to be killed in the battlel Thr. Not very
much; Ι was very well satisfied in my mind, having onos for all com·
mended myself to St. Barbara. Ila. And did she take you under her
protectionl Thr. I fancied so, for methought she gave me a little
nod. Ha. What timewas itt In the morning. Thr. No, no; it
was after supper. Ha And bythat time Ι suppose the trees ecemed
to walk tool Thr. How this man gnoseos everything! But St.
Christopher was the saint Ι most deponded on, whose picture Ι had
always in my eye. Ha. What, in yourtentl Thr. We had drawn
him with charooal upon our soil-eloth. Thr. Thsn, to be sure that
Christopher the collicr was a sure cord to trust to. But, without jest-
ing, I do not ees how you can expect to be forgiven all these villanicS,
unless you go to Rome. Thr. Yes‚ Ι can; Ι know a shorter way than
that. Ila. What way is thatl Thr. Ι will go to tho Dominioane, and
there I can do my business with the commissaries for a trifle. Ha.
What, for saerilege‘l Thr. Ay ; if Ι had robbed Christ himself, and
cut off His head afterwards, they have pardons would reaoh it, and
commissione large enough to coinpound for it. Ha. That is well
indeed, il' God should ratify your composition. Thr. Nay‚ Ι arn
rather afraid the devil should not ratify it3 God is of aforgiving
nature.

Ha. What priest will you get youl Thr. One that I know hae
but little modesty or honesty. Ha. Like tolike. And when that

once discharged the jakes of my sins into his oowl, and unburdened
myself of my luggage, let him look to it that absolved me. Ha. But
how can you be sure that he does absolve youl Thr. 1 know that
well enough. Ha. How do you know itl Thr. Because he laye
his hand upon my head and muttere over something, Ι don’t know
what. Ha. What if he should give you all your sins again when he
lays his hand upon your head, and these should be the words hc
matters to himself r-1 absolve thee from all thy good deeds, of which
I lind lew or none in thee; Ι restore thee to thy wonted manners, and
leave thee just as I found thee. Thr. Let him look to what he says;
itis enough for me that Ι believe Ι am ahsolved. Ha. But you run
a great hazard by that belief, for perhaps that will not be satisfaction
to God, to whom thou art indebted. Thr. Who in misohief put you
in my way to disturb my conscience, which was very quiet beforel
Ha. Nay, Ithink it is a very happy encountcr to meet a friend that
givos good advice, Thr. I cannot tell how good it is, but Ι am sure it
ie not very pleasant.
