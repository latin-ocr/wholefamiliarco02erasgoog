Hs. What is my Spudaeus hunting after. heis so intent upon his
book, muttering Iknew not what to himself l Sp. Hedonius, Ι was
indeed hunting, but that was all, iorI can catch nothing. He What
book is that in your bosoml Sp. Tully's “Dialogues ol the Ends of
Good Things.’' Ile. But isit not better to inquire after the beginning
estham than the endl Sp. Mark Tully calls a perfect good the end
of good, such as wbosoever obtains can desire nothing more. He. It
is, indeed, a very eloquent and learned piece; but have you done any· -
thing to the purpose as to the attainmeut ο1 the knowledge of the truthl
Sp. Indeed I seem te have got this good by it, that Ι am more in
uncertainty as to the ends of good than l was before. It is commonly
tbe case ο1 sarmers to be at uncertainty as to the ends of lands. He.
Ι wonder very much that thero is se great a disagreement in the
opinions ο1 so many great men concerning so great a matter. Sp.
No wonder at all, sor error is very fertile, but truth simple ; and they
being ignorant of the head and fountain of the whole affair, they—all
make absurd and doting gnoseos, But which opinion do you think
comes nearest to the truthl

He. When I meet with M. Tully opposing them,l like none ο1
them; again, when Ι find him desending them, 1 have not a word
te say against it. But to me the Stoica seem to be tha least out ο1 the
way, aad next to thern the Peripatetics. I like noscet so well as the
Epicureans. Sp. Tharais ne sect amongst them all that is so much
condemned by a universal consent He. Let us set prejudiee asida,
aud let Epicurus be what he will, let us consider the ¹thing iu itself.
He places the happiness of man in pleasure, and judges that life to be
most blessed that has most pleasure and least pain. Sp. He does se.
Ile What can be more divine than this sentencel Sp. Eveiybody
aries out, this is tho saying of a brute, rather than of a man. He. I
know they do, but they ure mistaken in the names of things. Ι1 we
will speak the truth nono are greater Epicureans than those Christiana
that live a picus life. Sp. They come nearer te it than the Cynies3
for they make their bodies lean with fasting, bewail their own weak-
nasses, either are poor or else make themselves so by their liberulity to
the poor, are oppresscd by the powcrful, and derided by the populace.
And 11 pleusure be that which makes happy, I think this kind of life
is as distant sroui pleasure as can well be.

He. Will you admit os Plautus for an authori Sp. Yes, 11 he
says that which is right. He. Then I will 'present you with one
sentence ο1 a naughty servant, that has more wisdom in it than all the
paradoxas ο1 the Stoica. Sp. Let me haurit lle. Nihil eat varnerius
quam anianus sibi nauli aeracius, nothing can be more wretched than a
guilty conscience. Sp. Ι approve the saying3 but what do you infer
from itl He. Ι1 nothing be more wretched than a guilty conscience,
it follows os consequence that nothing is more happy than a clear
conscience. Sp. A very good inference3 but in what part of the
world will you find a conscience that is clear from all that is cvilt
