Inthe Old Men's Discourse, how many things ara there that are
shswn as it were in a looking-glass‚ which either should be avoided in
life, or may render it comfortabla. lt is better for young persons ιο
learn these things by pleasant colloquias than by experienca. Socrates
brought philosophy down evan from heaven to earth, and Ι have made
it a diversion, brought it into familiar conversation, and to the

ln the Apparition Ι datast tha wiles of impostore, who are wont
to impose upon well-meaning credulous people‚ ιγ seigning apparitione
of devils, and souls, and voices from heaven. And what a great deal

forth tha manner of the impostura to tha life by a facetious example.
Pope Gelestina himself was imposed upon by such triclrs, and a young

are thus imposed upon ιγ davised eracles.

upon youth the Mammothrepti, Brachylogi, catholicontae, and the
