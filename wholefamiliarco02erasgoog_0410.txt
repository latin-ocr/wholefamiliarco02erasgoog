THE EPJOUREAN. 403

and sometimes makes what of itselfis hitter to he sweet. Sp. We
see that daily in those who are in love, who take apleasure in watching
and waiting all a cold winter’s night at their mistress’s door. He.
Well, then, consider with yourself, if human love have such a power,
which bulls and dogs have as well as we, how much more prevalent
will that heavenly love be that proceeds from the spirit ol Christ, the
power of which is so great that it can render death amiable, than which
there is nothing in the world more terriblel

Sp. Ι cannot tell what others feel within themselves, but Ι think
that they want a great many pleasures that adhere to true piety. He.
What pleasures do they go withoutl Sp. They do not get riches,
attain honours, junket, dance, sing, periume themselves, laugh and
play. Ha Yon should not have mentioned riches and honours in
this case, for they do not make a life pleasant, but rather full of cares
and anxiety. Iret us consider the other things, which are what they
hunt after that have a desire to live a pleasant life. Do you not see
every day drunkards, fools, and madmen laughing and dancing‘l Sp.
I do so. He. Do you think that they live pleasantly? Sp. I would
wish that pleasure to those Ι hate Ha Why sol Sp. Because their
mind is out of order. Hc. Then had you rather fast and study than
live after that mannerl Sp. Nay, I had rather dig. Hc. There is
no difference between a rich man and adrunken man, saving that sleep
will cure a drunken man, but doctore cannot cure a covetous man. A
natural fool differs from a brute only in the form of his body ; but they
are less miserable whom nature has made brutes, than they that have
made themselves so by their beastly lusts. Sp. I confess that.

He. Do you think that they are sober or in their right mind who,
for the sake of delusione and shadows ol pleasure, neglect the true
pleasures ol the mind, and bring upon themselves real tormentsl
Sp. They do not seem to be sc. He. Such persons are not drunk
with wine, but with love, with anger, with avarice, with ambition and
other filthy lusts, which is a drunkenness more dangerous than to bo
drunk with wine. Cyrus, in the comedy, after he had slept away his
debauch spoke sober things, but a mind drunk with vicious lust, how
hardly does that come to itselfl How many years does love, anger,
hatred, lust, luxury, and ambition torment the mindt How many do
we see that never wake out of the sleep of drunkenness, ambition,
avarice, lust, and luxury, and repent of them even from their youth to

decrepit old aget Sp. Ι know a great many such as those. He. ’

Yon have granted likewise that persons should not take false pleasures
fortrue ones. Sp. Ihave so, and I shall not eat my worda He.
That is no true pleasure that does not spring from true causes Sp.
Iownthat.

Hs. Then they are no true pleasures that mankind generally
pursue, rightor wrong. Sp. Ido not think they are. He. If they
were true pleasures they would only happen to good men, and render
them happy whose share they fall to. But as to pleasure, can that be
thought to be true that proceeds not from true good, but from the
false shadows of goodt Sp. By no means. Hs. But pleasure is that
which makes us live sweetly. Sp. It doesso. Ha Weltthen,none
lives truly pleasantly but he that lives piously—s'. a, that enjoys true
good. It is only piety that gains the favour of sod, the fountain ot'
