time a prebendsry was offered me, as they call it: it was a good sat
benefice, and Ι accepted it. (ΙΙ. That sort of life bas no good reputa·
tion among people. Eu. As human affairs go, Ι thought it was a
thing well worth the accepting. Do you look upon it a small happiness
to have so many advantages to fall into a man's mouth, as though they
dropped out of heaven, handsome houses vell furnished, a large
revenue, an honoursble society, and a church at hand to serve God in,
when you have amiud to itl Pa. Ι vas scandalised at the luxury
of the persons, sud the insamy os their concubinus, and because a
great many of that sort os men have an aversion to learning. Eu. I
do not mind what others do, but what I ought to do myself, eud
associate myself with tho better sort, is Ι cannot melre them that are
bad better.

Po. And is that the state of life you have always lived inl Eu.
Always, except four years that I lived at Padus. Pa. What did you
do therei Eo. These years I divided in this manner—I studied
physic a year and a hals, and the rest of the time divinity. PoWhy
sol Ea. That I might the better manage both soul and body, and
also sometimes be helpful by wey of advice to my friends. Ι preached
sometimes (upon occasion) according to my taient. And under these
circumstances 1 have led a very quiet life, being content with a single
benefice, not being ambitiously desirous of any more, and should have
refused it isit hsd been offered me. Pa. I vish ve could lesrn how
tha rest of our old compenious have lived, that vvere our familiare.
Eo. I can tell you somewhst of some of them ; but Ι see ve are not

same iun, and thore we will talk over tha rest at leisure.
