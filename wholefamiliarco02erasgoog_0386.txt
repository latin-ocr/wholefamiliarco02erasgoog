100 1110 many a year. aa In this sort 01 slow and consumptiva diseases
physicians frequently foratell the time 010 man's death 10 0 day. Pla
They do so. Pk. They told the patient that all the art 01 man could
do towards his preservation had been done 100 him already : that God,
indeed, could do what was beyond the power 01 physic to effect, but
according to human conjecture he had not above three days to live
Pa well, what did he do thenl Ta. The excellent Eusebius
immediately stripping himself starlr-nslred, puts ou the habit of the
most holy Francis, has bis head shaved,is dressed in an seh-coloured
oowl andgown,an hempen hnotted girdle, and 001 001 0100101 01000

according to the rule 01 St. Francis, and there were several holy men
called in to 10 witnesses 10 1110 profession In 1101 10111 1100 110
temous man, 01 110 very time that the physicians had 10001011 he would.

There came 0 great many of 1110100100011)1 10 000101 01 110 funeral
solemnity. Pla I wish I had been present 01 1110 sight Th. It
would have 1010101 10000 from your eyes to have seen with what tender-
ness the seraphia fraternity washed the body, fitted the holy habit 10 11,
1011 his hands one over another in the form 01 0 00000, 0000νο001 and
kissed his nahed feet, and according 10 110 precept 01 110 gospel
cheered up his countenanae with ointment. Pla What a prodigious
humility was this 100110 seraphia brethren to take upon thern tha
office 01 washers 001 10000001 Tb. When this was 1000, they laid it
upon the bier, and according to the doctrine 01 81 Paul, “ bear ye ane
another's burdens,’' the brethren took the brother upon their shoulders,
and carried him along the highway 10 110 monastery, and there they
interred him with tha usual songs and ceremonias. As this venerable
pomp was passing along the way, Ι observati a great many people that
could not forbear weeping 10 000 0 man that used to go in silk and
0000101 now wrapped in a Francisaan’s habit, girded about with 0 rope's
end, and the whole body disposed in such a posture as must needs
move devotion ; 100, as I said, his head was laid upon his shoulder, and
his arms 000000, 001 everything else carried a wonderful appearance 01
10110000. And then the march os the seraphia brethren themselves,
with their heads hanging down, their eyes fixed upon the ground, and
their mournful looks, so mournful that I can scarae think that in heli
itself there can 10 anything beyond it, drew sighs and tears in
abundanae 10000 110 1011011000

Ph. But 101 10 110 five wounds 01 81 Francis 1001 Tb. Ι 1000
001 affirm that 100 0 certainty, but I saw some bluish scars in his hands
and feet, and there was a 1010 10 the 1011 0110 01 110 gown'3 but Ι 111

001 1000 10 look too narrowly, 100 they say many people have been “

001000 by being too aurious in these matters. Pla. But did you not
see soma that laughed 1001 110 Yes, I did take notice 01 some 3 but
I believe they were heresim-there are 100 many 01 them in the world
now-adays. Pla Well, my Theotimus, 10 deal honestly with you, if
Ι had been there, in my conscience, I beheve I should scarae have been
able 10 sorbear laugbing too 100 company. Pb. Pray (101 you have
