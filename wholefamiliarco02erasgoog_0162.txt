11111 l'OUNG MAN AND THE HARLOT. 155

There is no namo more noted among us. So. Did you ever see himl
La. No, I never saw him 3 but 1 should he glad 10 111 him, I have
heard 10 many bad reporta of him. So. It may be you have heard
them from them that are bad themselves. Ila. Nay‚ 11011 rnen of
. the gown. Se. Who are theyl Lu. It is not convenient to name
names. So. Why 101 Lu. Because if you should blab 11 out, and
it should come to their 1111, Ι should lose a great many good sullies.
So. Don’t be afraid, Iwill not speaks word of it. Ῑιιι, Whisper
then. So. You foolish girl, what need is there to whisper when
there is nobody but ourselvesl What, lest (1011 should hearl Ah,
good (1011 1 Iperceive you are a religious whore, that relievest mendi-
11111. Lu. Iget more by them beggam than by you rich men. So.
They rob honest women 1ο lavish it away upon naughty strumpets
Lu. But go on as to your boolr.

So. So Iwill, and that is best. In that bools Paul, that cannot
lie, told me that neither whores nor whoremongers shall obtain the
kingdom of heaven. When I read this, Ibegan thus to think with my-
self: Itis but a small matter that I 10011 101 from my father-’s inherit·
ance, and yet I can renounce all the whoies in the world rather than he
disinherited by my father 3 how much more then ought I to take care ‡
1111 my heavenly Father should diainherit mel And human lawe do
afford 10111 111111 11 the case of a father's disinheriting or discerding a·
son. But here is no revision at all made in case of God‘s disinherit-
ing ; and upon that 1 immediately tied myself up from all conversa·
tion with lewd women. Lu. Ι1 will be well if you can hold it.

So. It 11 1 good step towards 1011111111 10 desire to be 10. And
last 01 111, there is one remedy left, and that 11 a wife. When Iwas
11 Rome Ι emptied the whole jakes 01 mysius into the bosom 01 1
101111101. And he exhorted me very earnestly 10 purity both 01 mind
and body, and 10 the reading 01 the holy scripture, to frequent prayer,
and to sobriety 01 life, and enjoined me no other penance but thatl
should, upon my bended knees before the high altar, say this psalm,
“Have mercy upon me,O God ;'' and that if I had any money,I
should give one penny 10 some poor person. And I wonden'ng that
for so many whoring tricks he enjoined me so small a penance, he
ansvered me very pleasantly, “My son,” says he, “if you truly repent
and change your life, Ι don’t lay much 111111 upon the penance3 but
11 thou shalt go on in it, the very lust itself will at last punish thee
very severely, although the priest impose none upon thee.'’ Look
upon me, I 111 blear-eyed, troubled with the palsy, and go stooping.
Time was Iwas such a 011 as you say you have been heretofore. And
thus Irepented.

ha. Thea, as far as I pereeive, I have lost my Sophroniua. So.
Nay, you have rather gained him, 101 he was lost before, and was
neither his own friend nor thino neither. Now he loves thee in
reality, and longe for the salvation of thy 1011. Im. What would
you have me do then, my Sophroniusl So. To leave 011 that course
of life out of hand. Thou art but a girl yet, and that stain that you
have contracted may be wiped 011111 time. Either marry, and Ι will
give you something toward 1 portion, or go into some cloister that
takes in. craeked maids, or go into some strange place and get into
101111 honest family. I will lend you my assistance to any 01 these.
