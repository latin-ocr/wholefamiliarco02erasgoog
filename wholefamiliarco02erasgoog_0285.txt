of a sort ol pharisees who have no other way οι· sppearing religious but

by such superstitious, who would neither be deprived of their ostenta· '

tious sanotity, nor suffer their successore to have more liberty than
they had themselves. Nor, indeed, would it be for the interest of
butchers to have a free toleration ιο eat everything3 sor theu our trade
would be very uncertain, for now our profit is more certain, and we
run less hazards, as well as have less trouble. Fi. What you say is
very true, and we should be in the same condition. Bu. Ι am glad
here is something found out at last, theta fishmouger aud butcher can
agree in. But ιο begin to talk seriously, as perhaps it would be con-
venient for christinus not to be tied up ιο so many ceremonies,
especially to such as make but very little to true religion, not to say
that make against it ; so I have no mind to vindicate those persons
who reject and set light by all human ordinances; nay, such aa often
do many things because they are forbid to do them. Yet I cannot but
wonder at the absurd notions os mankind in many things. Fi. Nor
can I help wondering at them neither.

Ba. We are ior confounding heaven and earth together, if we do
but suspect any danger of lesseuing the authority of priests, as to their
impositione ; and are all asleep when we are under imminent danger
of attributing so much ιο ιιο authority of man, that the authority of
uod suffers by it. So we avoid one evil aud fall into another far mors
pernicieus. That there is honour due ιο bishops nobody denies,
especially if they act agreeably to what they talk. But it is a wicked
thing to transfer the honour due ιο God alone upon meu; and in doing
too much honour ιο men, to dc ιοο little to God. God is to be
honoured and reverenced in our neighbour; but, however, we ought to
take care at the same time that God, by this means, be not robbed of
His honour. Fi. We see a great many men lay so much stress upon

· corporal ceremonias, that relying upon them they neglect matters of

real religion, arrogating that to their own merits which ought to be
attributed ιο ιιο divine bouuty ; and their taking up their station
where they should begin to ascend ιο greater perfection, and reviling
· their neighbour ior those things that in themselves are neither good
nor bad.

Ba. And when in the same matter there are two things, oue
better than the other, we commonly choose the worst of them. 'The
body aud those things that belong to the body are everywhere made
mere account of than those of the mind And it is accounted a great
crime to kill a man, and indeed it is so, but ιο corrupt men’s minda
with poisonous doctrine and pernicious principles is made a jest on.
If a priest leta his bair grow 01· wears a lay habit, he is thrown into
prison ond severely punished3 but if he sits tippling in a bandy-house
with whores, games, or debauches other men’s wives, and never takes a
Bible iu his hand, he is still a pillar of the church. Not that I excuse
the wearing a lay habit, but l accuse the absurdity cf men’s notione.
Fi. N ay, if he shall neglect to say his prayera at stated hours, he must
be excomrfpunicated 3 but if he be an usurer, cr guilty of simouy, he
goes scot ee.

Bu. 1f anybody sees a Carthasian in adress not of the order, or
eating flcsh, how does he curse him, tremble at the sight, and fall into
airight, lest the earth should open and swallow uplhim for wearing,
