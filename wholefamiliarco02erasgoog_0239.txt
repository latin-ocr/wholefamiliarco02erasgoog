232 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

Ea. The Holy Scriptores condescend to those lew expressions because

of the dulness os men, to signify a mind pure from all commerce os
sensible things. m. Tlien what is the difference between an angel
and a mindi Eu. The same that is between a snail and a cockle, or,
if you like the comparison better, a tortoise.

Fa. Thon the body is rather the habitation of the mind than the
instrument of it. Eu. There is no absurdity in calling an adjunct
instrument an habitation. Philosophers are divided in their opinions
about this. Some call the body the garment of the seul, some the
house, some the instrument, and some the harmony 3 call it by which
ol* these you will, it will follow that the actions of the mind are
impeded by the affectione of the body. In the first place, is the
body is to the mind that which a garment is to the body, the
garment of Hercules informs us how much a garmeut contributes
to the health of the body, netto take any notice of colours of
hairs or of skins But as to that question, whether one and the
same soul is capable of wearing out many bodies, it shall be lest to
Pythagoras. Fa. If, according to Pythagoras, we could make use of
change of bodies as we do of apparel, it would be convenient to take a
fat body and of a thick texture in winter time, and a thinner and
lighter body in summer time. Eu„ But l am os the opinion that
if we wore out our body at last as we do our clothes, it would not be
convenient, for so having worn ont many bodies, the soul itsels would
grew old and die. Fa It would not truly. Ea. As the sort of
garment that is worn hath an influenee on the health and agility
of the body, so itis of grem moment what body the seul wears. Fa.
If indeed the body is the garment of the seul, 1 see a great many that
are dressed after a very different manner. Eu. Right, and yet some
part of this matter is in our own power, how conveniently our seule
shall be clothed

Fa Come, have done with the garment, und say something con-
cerning the habitation. Em But, Fabullo, that which Ι say to you
may n‘ot be thoughts fiction3 the Lord desua calls his body a temple,
and the apostle Peter calls his a tabernaclo. And there have been
some that have called the body the sepulchre of the seul, supposing

it was called σῶμα, as though it were σῆμα. Some eall it the prison
of the mind, and some the fortress or sortilied castle. The mindo of
persons that are pure in every pert dwell in the temple. They whose
minds are not taken up with the love of corporeal things, dwell in a
tent, and are ready to como forth as soon as the commender calls
Tho seul of those that are not wholly blinded with vice and filtbiness,
so that they never breathe aster the air of gospel liberty, lies in a
sepulchre. But they that wrestle hard with their vices, and cannot
yet be able to do what they would do, their soul dwells in a prison,
whence they frequently cry out to the deliverer of all, Bring my seul
out of prison, that I may praise thy name. They who light strenuously
with Satan, watehing and guarding against his snores, who goes about
aa a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, their soul is, as it
lwere, in a garrison, out of which they must not go without the generalis
eave.

Fa. If the body be the habitation or house οἰ the seul, I see a
