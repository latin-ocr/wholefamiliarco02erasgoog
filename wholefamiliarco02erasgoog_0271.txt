· Fi. In 110 first place, it does not appear that God bas forbidden
the eating swine's flesh, meaning that a man should rather be accessory
to his own death than eat it. For 110 Lord excuses David in that hs
ate shewbread contrary 10 the* letter 01 110 100. And in the Baby·
lonish captivity manythings were omitted by the Jews which were
required by the law. Secondly,I am 01 opinion that the law which
nature has dictated, and therefore is perpetual and inviolable, ought to
be accounted the more obligatory‚ which never was nor ever will be
abrogated. Bu. But why, then, were the hiaccabees so much com·
mended that chose ratberto diethan 001 swine’s 110011 Fi. 1 suppose
because this eating being required by the king, did comprise in itaelf
a denial in the general of the law 01 110 country 3 00 circumcision,
which tha Jews endeavoured 10 obtrude on the Gentiles, carried in it

Bal Well, then, if this mors gross part 01 110 100 10 justly taken
away, after the exhibition of the gospel, by what authority are either
the same or like things imposed upon ns, especially when our Lord
calls His yoke an easy one, aud Peter, in the Acts 01 110 Apostles, 00110
110 100 01 110 Jews a hard one, which neither they nor their fathers
were able to bear! circumcision is taken away, but baptism came in
110 room 01 11, and, indeed, 1 was about 10 say, with a harder condition.
That was deferred till the eighth day; and if anything happened to the
child in that time, the row 01 circumcision was taken for circumcision
itself. But we dip children 000000 0011 got out 01 110 dark caverna of
the mother's womb, all over in cold water, which has stood 0 long time
in a stony font (not 10 say while it stinks), and if it chance to die upon
the first day, or in 110 very ingress into the world, though there be no
fault neither 10 110 parents nor friends, the poor babo is doomed to
eternal damnatiom Fi. They do say so indeed.

Bu. The sabbath is abrogated3 nay, indeed, not abrogated, bnt
translated to the Sanday. What does it signifyf The Mosaic law
enjoined a few 1001 days, bnt what 0 number have we added to them 1
And aa 10 110 choico of meets, how much freer were the Jews than we
are, who were 01 liberty 10 001 sheep, capons, partridges, and kids all
the yenr round 1 They were forbid the use of no garment, 101 what
was mixed with 11000 001 woollen. But now, besides the appointed
and forbidden forms and colonrs 01 0 great number 01 garments, the
head must be sharen too, some after one manner, and some another.
Not to mention that heavy burdcn 01 confession, the wallets 01 human
constitutions, tithes‚ and those not single ones neithor; matrimony
screwed up into too narrow a compass, the 000 1000 01 affinity, and
abundance of other things, which render the J ews’ circumstances much
more easy than curs.

Jb'. indeed, butcher, you are much 001 01110 way,the yoke 01
Christ 10001 10 10 accounted for by 1101 0010 you imagine. A Christian
istied up in many points, and 10 harder circumstances, and liable to 0
greater punishment. But 10 make amends for 1110, 110 greater
strength of faith and love that is added makes those things pleasant
which by nature are burdensome. Bu. Pray, 1011 me why, when the
Holy Spirit descended from 100000 01 011, 10 110 shape of fiery tongues,
and enriched the hearts of believers with a moro copious gin 01 saith
