say, in houses where it rains in, that are dark, exposed to all winde,
that are smoky, damp, decayed, and ruinous, and such 11 111 filthy and
insected; and yet Cato accounts it the principel happiness 011 man to
dwell handsomely. ι Fa. It were tolerable, 11 there was any passing out
01 one house into another. Era. There is no going out before the land-
lord calls out. But though we cannot go out, yet we may by cur art
and care make the habitation 01 our mind commodicus; as in a house
the windcws are changed, the floor taken up, the walls are either
plastered or wainscotted, and the situation may be purified with fire
or persume. But this 1 very hard matter in an old body that 11 near
iteruin. But it is 01 great advantage 10 the body 011 child to take
the care 01 11 that ought to be taken presently after its birth.

Fa. You would have mothers and. nurses to be doctore. Era So,
indeed, I would as 10 the choice and moderate use 01 meat, drink, motion,
sleep, bathe, unctione, frictions, and clothings. How many 110 there,
think you, who are exposed to grievous diseases and vice, as epilepsies,
1011111111, weekness, deal'ness, broken baoks, crooked limbs, 1 weak
brain, disturbe'd minda, and for no other reason than that their nurses
have not taken 1 due care 01 theml Fa. I wonder you are not rather
, 1 Franciscan than a painter, who presch so finely. It'a. When you
arc 1 nun 01 the order 01 St. Clare, then I will be a Franciscan, and

p Fa. lii truth, I would fain know what the soul is, about which we
hear so much and- talk of so often, and nobody has seen. aa. Nay,
everybody sees it that 1111 eyes. Fa. I see souis painted in the
shape 01 little infants3 but why do they put wings to them aa they do
to angelsl Ea. Why, because, if we¹ oen give any credit to the
sables 01 Socrates, their wings were broken by their falling from
heaven. Fa. How, then, are they said to fly up to heavent Eu.

, Because saith and charity make their wings grow again. He that

was weary 01 this house 01 his body begged 101 these wings,
when he cried out,th will give me the wings 011 dove, that I

the body. But those things that are perceived by the mind are
more certain. Dc you believe the being 01 Godl Fa. Yes, 1 do.
Eu. But nothing is more invisible than God. Fa. He is seen in the
works 0101011101. Ea. In like manner the saulis seen in action. 11
you would know 11011111011111 1 living body, consider a dead body.
When you see a man feel, sec, hear, move, understand, remember‚ and
reason, you see the soul to be in him with more certainty than you see
this tankard; 101 one sense may be deceived, but so many proofs 01 the
senece cannot deceive you.

Fa. Well, then, 11 you cannot shew me the soul, paint it out to me
just as you would the king, whom I never did see. Eu. 1 have
Aristotle’s definition ready for you. Fa. What is it, 101 they say he
was 1 very good decipherer 01 everything. Eu. The 10111111110101
an organical physical body, having life in potentia. Fa. Why does
he rather call itan 101 than a journey or weyt Eu. Here is no regard
either 10 coachmen 01 horsemen, but a bare definition 01 the soul.
And he 01111 the form act, the nature 01 which is to aot, when it is the

property 01 matter to suffer. For. all nptural motion 01 the body
