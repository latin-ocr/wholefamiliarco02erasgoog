man’s name and place where he lives shall'be coneesled. There

· was a cousin of mine, a prior that was next in degree to the

abbet of the Benedictine Order, but of that sort that don¹t eat flesh‚
unless it were out of the place they eall the great refectory ;
he was aceounted a learned man, and he was desirous to be so
aeeounted, about fifty years of age. It was his daily practice to drink
freely and live merrily, and enee every twelve days to go to the het-

· houses, to sweat eut the diseases of his reins. Fi. Harl he where-

v'rithal to live at that ratel Be. About six hundred florius a year.
Fi. Such a poverty I myself would wish for. Bu. In short, with
drinking and whoring he had brought himself inte a eonsurnptien
The doctore had given lrim every the abbot ordered him to eat flesh,
adding that terrible sentence, upon pain of disobedienee ; buthe,
though at the point of death, could searce he brought to toste flesh,
though sor many years he had had no aversien ιο desh.

Fi. A prior and an abbot well matehed! Ι guess who they are,
for I remember I have heard the same story from their own mouths.
Bu. Guess. Fi. Is not the abbat a lusty fat man, that has a stam-
mering in his speeeh; and the prior a little man, but straightbodied
and long-visagedl Ba. You have guessed right.

Fi. Well, now, Ι will nralre you amends3 Ι will tell you what I
saw with my own eyes but the other day, and what I was net only
presentat, but was in a manner the chief actor. There were two nuns
that went to pay a visit to some of their kinsfolks; and when they
came to the place, their man-servant had left behind him their prayer-
book, whieh was according to the eusteru of the order and place where
they lived. Good God! what a vexatione thing that was! They did
not darete go ιο supper before they had said their vespere, nor could
they read in any hook but their own ; and at the same time all the
company was in great haste to ge to supper; the servant rumbach,
and late at night brings the book, and by that time they had said
their prayers, aud got ιο supper, it was ten 0'cloek at night. Ba
That is not much ιο he found fault with hitherto Fi. You have
heard hut one part of the story yet. At supper the nuns began ιο

noise they made; but nobody used more freedom than those two vir-
gins that would not go ιο supper before they had said their prayers.
After supper there was daneiug, singing of lasciviens songs, and such
doings I am ashamed ιο speak of, insomueh that I aru much afraid that
night hardly passed very honestly3 if it did, the wauton plays, nods,
and kisses deceived me.

Bu. I do net blame the nuns for this so much as the priests
that look after them3 but, come on, I will give you story fer story, or
rather a history that I myself was an eye-witness of. A little while
since there were seme persons sent to prison for baking broad on
a Sunday, though at the same time they wanted it. Indead, 1 de not
blame the (leod, but 1 do the punishment. A little after, being Palm
Sunday‚ Ι had occasion to go to the next street, and being there about

four o'eloek in the afternoon, I saw a sight, I eanuot well tell whether
I shall eall it ridiculous or wretched. 1 searee believe any bacchanals
over had so much lewdness in thern ·, tome were so drunli they reeled
