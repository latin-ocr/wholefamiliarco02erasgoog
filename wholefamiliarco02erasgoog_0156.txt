Bert. I wonder what is the fancy 01 8 great many for staying two
or three days at Lyonsl When 1 have once set out 08 8 journey Ι 881
801 81 1081 1111 Ι comete my journeys end. tht. Nay, 1 wonder 88
much that anybody can get away from thence. Bert. But why 801
11111 Because that is a place the companions 01 Ulysses could not have
got away frona There are syrena. Nobodyis better entertained at
his own house than 110 18 there at an inin Bert. What is done
therel ·

Will. Tharais 8 woman always waiting at table, which makes tho
entertainment pleasant with railleries and pleasant jests3 and 1110
women are very handsome there. First, the mistress 01 the house came
aud bade us welcume, and to accept kindly what fare we should have;
81101 her comes her daughter, 8 very fine woman, 01 80 handsome a

acquainted with, and familiar friends. Bert. Oh, 1 know the French
way 01 civility very well. tht And because they cannot be always
with you, hy reason 01 the other affairs 011110 house, and 1110 wel-
00818301011101380818,111010 comes a lass that supplies the place 01
the daughter till 8110 18 81 1818810 10 181818 again. This lass is so well
instruoted in the knack 01 1011811088, that she has 8 word ready 101
everybody, and no conceit comes 881188 10 her. The mother, you must
know, was somewlrat in years. Bert. But what was your table
furnished with, 101 stories fill no belliesl Will. Truly, so splendid
that Ι was 88181011 that they could afford 10 881011818 their guests 80
18180 small 8 price. And 1110881101 dinner they 8818118111 8 1888

went matters 18 your chambersl

11111 Why, there was everywhere some pretty lass or other
giggling and playing wauton tricksl They asked us 11 we had any
foul 11808 10 wash, which they wash and bring to us again. In 8 word, ,
we saw nothing there but young lasses and women, except in the
stables, and they would every now and then run in there 100. When
you go away they embrace you, and part with you with as much affec·
tion as 11 you were their own brothers or near kinsfolk.

Bert. This mode, perhaps, may become the French, but methinks
the way 01 the Germana pleases 810 better, which is more manly.

to tell how they entertain a traveller. Bert. Icannot tell whether
the method 01 081811818183 he the same everywhere ; but Ι will tell you
what I saw there. N obody bida 8 guest welcume, lest he should seem
to court his guests to come 1011118, 10111181 they look upon 10 be sordid
and mean, and not becoming the German gravity. When you have
called a good while at the gato, at length one puts his head out 01 the
