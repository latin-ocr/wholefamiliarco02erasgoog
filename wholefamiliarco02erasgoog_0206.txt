Peter hath married faiihilornelia,
Propitious Hoeven, blesa the wedding-day.

Melpomene.

And of the jackdaw the vivacity.
Thalia.

From Gracchus may he win the princ,
And for Cornelia’s life his own despise.

May she in love excfezdwiipcimetus's wife,
Who laid her own down for her husband’s life.

Terpsichora
May he love her with stronger flante,
But much more happy fate,
Than Plancius, who did disdain

To outlive hia deceased mate.

Erato.
May she love him with no less dame,
But with much better fate,
Than Porcia chaste her Brutus did,
Whom bravo men celebrata

Calliope.

For constancy‚ I wish tho bridegroom may
Be equal to the famous N asioa.

Urania.
The bride in chastity‚ may she
Superior to Paterculana be.
