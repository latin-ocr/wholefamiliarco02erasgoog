simple from falling into the like mistakes; for some learned and pious
men have frequently complained to me that the superstition and
wickedness of some few brings a scandal upon the whole order.

Ma This is well and bravely said. But Ι would fain know what
became of Cornelius. Ph. Why, truly, he died as he lived, without
troubling anybody. He badan anniversary fever, which took him
every year at such a certain time ; but being now worse than ordinary,
either by reason of age (for he was above sixty years old), or some other
cansa, finding that his fatal day was drawing ou, he went to church
upon a Sunday, four days before he died, confessed to the parish priest,
heard divine service and the sermon, and having received the sacra·
ment, went home. Mo. Had he no physiciansl Pla Only one, who
was as good in morale as he was in his professi0n; his name is James
Oastrntius. Mo. Iknow him, as honest a man as any in the world.
Ph He told him he should be ready to serve him in anything he could ,
as a friend, but that, in his opinion, his business lay rather with God
than the doctor. Cornelius received his answer as cheerfully as if he
had assured him of his recovery. Wherefore, although he had been
always very charitable according to his power, yet he then bestowed
upon the needy all that he could possibly spare from the necessities of
his wife and children, not upon such as take a seeming pride in a sort
of poverty that are everywhere to be met withsl, but upon those good
men that oppose a laborious industry to an innocent poverty.

Ι desired him that he would betake himself to his bed, and send
for a minister to him, rather than fatigue his weak body. He replied
that it had been always his desire rather to make his friends easy
where he could, by doing good offices, than to make himself trouble·

some to them by receiving, and that he was now willing to die as he ²

had lived. Nor would he take to his bed till the very last day, and part
of tho last night of his life. ln the interim he supported his weak body
with a stick, or else sat in a chair, but very raroly went into the naked
bed, but lay down in his clothes, his head being raised. And 111 this
time he was either giving orders for the relies of the poor, especially
those of his acquaintance and neighbours, or reading something of the
scriptores proper to strengthen his faith in God, or that shew His love
to mankind. And when he was so tired that he could not read himself,
be heard some friend read to him, and would very frequently, and
with wonderful affection, exhort his family to mutual love and concord,
and the exercise of true piety3 comforting his friends, who were solici-
tous for his death, with great tenderness, and gave it often in ohargs
to his family to take care to see all his debts pald.

Mo. Hsd he not made a willt Pla Yes, a long time before, he
had taken care to do that when he was in perfect health ; for he was
used to say, that what a man did at his last gasp was rather a dotage
than a testament. Mo. Had he given anything to monasterias or

poor peoplel Ph. No, not a cross3 1 have, says he, already in my ι

lifetime given according to my ability, and now, as Ι leave the posses·
sion of what Ι have to my family, 1 leave them the disposing of it too,
and I trust that they will employ it better than I have done. Ma
Did he send forno boly men, as Georgo didi Pa. Not a man; there
was nobody about him hut his own family and two intimate friends.
Mo. I wonder what he meant by that. Ph. He said he was not will-
