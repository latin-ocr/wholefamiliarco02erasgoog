Α All health 10 you the best 01 men. Eu. 010 blessing upon you all,

my 1001 friends. What god 01 providentia] chance has brought us
together now, 1011 believe none 0100 have 0001110 010110 other 1011110
sorty years. Why, Mercury with his mace could nothave more luckily
brought ιιι together into a circle, but what are you doing 10101 Pa.
We are sitting. Eu. Iaee that, but what do you 0111011 Ρο. We
weit 101 110 Antwerp waggon 110. What, are you going to the 10111
Ρο. We are so, but rather spectatore 1101 1101010, though one has one
business and another· has another. Eu. Well, and Ι am going thither
myself 100. But what hinders you that you 010 101 goingl Po. We
have not agreed with the waggoner yet.

110. These waggoners are a surly sort 01 people; but are you
willing that we put a triok upon theml Po. With all my 10011, 11 it '
can be done fairly. Eu. We will pretend that we will go thither 01001
together. Po. They will sooner believe that a erabfish will fly, 1101
1101 such heavy follows as we will take such a journey on 1001 110.
Will you follow good wholesome advioel Po. Yes, by all means
st. They are a drinking, and the longer they are a fuddling 110 more
danger we shall 10 in 01 being overturned iu 110 dirt. Po. Yon must
come very early, 11 you find a waggoner 00101. Gt. Let us hire the

10 made up by many advantages, we shall have 111 more roomimand shall
pass the journey more pleasantly in mutual conversation. Po. Glycion
is much in the right 01 11 For good company in 0 journey does the
office 01 0 00001, 011 according to the Greek proverb, we shall have
more liberty 01 talking, not about a waggon, but in a waggon.

st. Well, I have made 0 bargain, let us get up. Now I have a mind
to 10 marry, seeing 1 have had the good luck to 000 my old dear
comrades 01101 00 long 0 separation. Ee. And methinks 1 seem to
grow young again. Po. How many years do you reckon it 01100 we
lived together at Paris 1 110. Ι believe it is not 1000 1101 two and forty
years. Pa. 1101 we seemed to be all pretty much 01 01 ege. 110.
We were so, pretty near the matter, 101 if there was any differente it
was very little. Po. But what agraet diffcrenoe does there seem 10
10 nowl For Glycian has nothing 01 01 011 man about him, and
Polygamus looks old enough to be his grandfather. aa. Why, trnly

ol. More than ducats in my pocket. Po. Well, but how manyl Gl.
Threescore and six. 110. Why, thou wilt neverbe old. Po. But by
what arte hast thou kept off old age, 1οι· you have 10 grey 10110, 101
