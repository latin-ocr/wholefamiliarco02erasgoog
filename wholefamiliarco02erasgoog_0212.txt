its keeper, the devil ; and, if you plesse, you may let this betha third
aot of this la. '
As 10111101 fourth act, Faunus began in good earnest everywhere
to talk high, and to talk of nothing else in all companies undat the
table, and to promise glorious things to monasterias, and talkad of
nothing that was low and mean. He goes to the place and finds the
tohens, but did not dare to dig for the treasure, because the spirit had
thrown this cantion in the way, that it would be extremely dangerous
to touch tha treasure before the manses had been performed. By this
· time a great many of the wiser sort had smelt out the plot, while
Faunus at the same time was everywhere proclaiming hie folly 3 though
he was privately cautioned by his friends, and especially his abbot, that
he who had hitherto had the reputation of a prudent man should not
give the world a specimen of his being quite contrary. But the
imagination of the thing had so entirely possessed his mind that all
that could be said os him had no influenoe upon him, to make him
doubt of the matter, and he droamt of nothing but spectres and devils.
The very habit of his mind was got into his face, that he was so pale,
and meagre, and dejected, that you would say he was rather a sprite
than a man. And, in short, he was not far from being stark mad, and
would have been so had it not been timely preveuted. .
Pto. Well, let this be the last act of the play. Ans. Well, you
shall have it. Polus and his son-in-law hammered out this pieoe
betwixt them. They counterfeited an epistle written in a strange
antique character, and not upon common paper, but such as goldbeatars
put their leaf-gold in, areddish paper, you lrnow. 'l'he form of the
epistle was thus:

Faunus, long a captive, but now free. Το Faunus, his gracious
deliverer, sends eternal health. There is no need, my dear Faunus,
that thou shouldest macerate thyself any longer in this affair: God has
tflttt lt ltfsnitlff.‘ll&stultitiastultit?
Thou hast a place provided for thee with St. Austin, which is next to
the choir of the apostles: when thou comestio us l will give tbee
public thanks. ln the meantime see that thou live merrily.

From the Imperial Heaven, the
Ides of September, Auno 1498.
Under the seal of my own ring.

This epistle was laid privately under the altar where Faunus was
to perform divine service. This being done there was one appointed
to advertise him of it, as if he had found it by chance. And now he
carries the letter about him, and shews it as a very sacred thing, and
believes nothing mora firmly than that it was brought from heaven by
an angel. Tho. This is not delivering the man from his medaeas, but
changing the sort of it. rias. Why truly, so it is, only he is now
more pleasantly mad than before. Tho. I never was wont to give
much credit to storias of apparitione in common, but for the time to
oome I shall give much less; forI believe that many things that have
been printed and published as true relations were only by artifice and
impostura impositione upon credulous persons and such as Faunus. Ana. ’
And 1 also believe that a great many of them are of the same kind.
