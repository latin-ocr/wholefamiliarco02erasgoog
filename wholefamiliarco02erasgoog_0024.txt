Young studente may learn many such things out 11 my colloquias,
against which these men make such a murmuring. But, say they, it
does not becomes divinato jest; but let them grant me to do this, at

least among boys, which they themselves take the liberty todo among
s 111111 in their Vespa-aa aa they call them, afoolish thing by a 11111111

As 111 those foolish calumnies that some Spaniards have cast upon
me, Ι have shewn that they are mere dreams 11 men that are neither
sober nor well understanding the Iatin tongue3 nor has that less 11
learning' 111 11, where one has said that it rs an heretical expression that
in the creed the Father 11 called simply the Author of all things, 111
he, being deceived by his 1311111111 11 the Latin 11113111, thinks thot
author signifies nothing else but creator or framer. But if he shall
consult those that are well skilled' 111 the Latin 11113111, if he shall read
Hilsry and other ancient authors, he will find that authority 11 taken
sor that which the sohoolmon call the most perfect cause 11 the
beginning, and therefore they attribute it peculiarly to the Father, and
by the name 11 Author often mean the Father, when they compare the
persons among themselves, Whether the Father can rightly be called
the cause 11 the Son does not concern me, seeing l have never used the
word Son ς unless that this is most true, that we cannot speak 11 God
but in improper words, nor are the Fountain, or Beginning, or Original
more proper words than the (lause.

Now, reader, consider with me what sort of persons sometimes
they are, who by their notions bring men to the stake. There 11
nothing more base than to find fault with that thou dost not under·
stand. But that vioe 11 vilifying everything, what does it produce but
bitterness and discordi Therefore let us candidly interpret other
men’s worlrs, and 1111 esteem our own as oracles, nor look upon the
judgments 11 those men as oraoles who do not understand what they
read Where there is hatred in judging, judgmentisblind. Maythot
Spirit which 111111 Pacifier 11 111, who uses his instrumenta various
ways, make us all agree and consentin sound doctrine, and holy
manners, that we may all come to the followship 11 the new Jerusalem
that knows no discorda. Amen

In the Yoar 1526, st Basil.
