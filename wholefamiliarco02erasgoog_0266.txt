ICHTHYOPHAGIA; OR, FISHMTING. 259

this reason, that they think, as it really is, that the city is defiled by
saltfishmongers3 the land, the waters, rivers, air, and fire are infected,
and all the other elements, if there be any more, men's bodies corrupted
and filled with putrid humours by the eating of fish3 from whence
‘ prooeed severs, oonsumprions, geute, falling-sicknesses, leprosies, aud
what not of diseases Fi. But, prithee, tell me, Hippocrates, how it
comesto pass that in well-governed eities it is forbid to kill oxen and
hogs within the walls of the cityl sor it would tend more to the
healthfulness of the city if they were restrained from killing sheep in
it too. Why is there a certain place appointed for butehers spart from
others, but lest if they had liberty to rove about and settle anywhere,
they should iniect the whole cityl Is there any kind of stink so
pestilential as that of the corrupted blood and gore of beastsl Bu.
They ere mere persumes compared to stinking fish.

Fi. You, perhaps, may think them persumes, but it isa sign the
magistrates thought otherwise that expelled you the city. Besides
that, how fragrant your slaughter-houses smell is very plainly seen, by
people stopping their noses when they pass by them, and that they had
rather have ten bawds for their neighbous than one buteher. Bu.
Wholc ponds and rivers are little enough sor you to wash your stink-

you perfume it. Neris it to be wondered at that they smell so strong
when they are dead, when many stink alive, and as soon as they are
taken. Flesh‚ piokled up, is so far from stinking that it may be pre-
served many years, and smell as sweet as a violet at last3 noy, being
but salted up with common salt will never stink; and being hung up
a drying in smoke, or wind, will have no ill scent. But do what you
will to a fish it will smell like a fish still. It is evident thereis no
stink to be compared to that of fish; that fish corrupte even salt itself,
which was given ior the very end of preserving things from putrefac-
tion, by shutting, binding up, and also forcing out that which should
produce anything nauseous, and drying up the humours within from
whence putrefaction might come: fish is the only thing on which salt
loses its efficacy.

It may be some nice beau or other may stop his nose as he pasees
by a buteher's shop, but nobody can bear to be in the boat where your
salt fish is. If a traveller chance to meet a cart leden with salt fish
on the read, how does he run away, stop his nose, hawk und spit, and
curse the stinking cargol And if it were possible that salt fish could
be eamied sweet into the city, as we do our beef when killed and
dressed, the law would be laid aeide. But besides, what cen you say
as to them that stink while they are eatenl and besides, how often
do we see your condemned ware thrown into the rivers by the clerks
of the markets, and a fine put upon you for selling itl And we should
see that oftener, but that they, corrupted by you, do not so much
regard the city’s good as their own profit. Neris this the only thing
that you are notorious for, but besides that, there isawicked com-
bination among you to hinder fresh from coming to town.

rt Pray, did nobody ever know a buteher fined for killing
measled pork, or selling mutton drowned in a ditch, or maggoty
shoulders of mutton daubed over with fresh blood, to make them look
