me to run mad, as I am told he has done to many who have denied
the print 01 the five wounds. Ph. Why, then, the saints are worse in
heaven than they were upon earth. I have heard that St. Francis
was 01 00 meek a disposition that, when boys out 01 roguery would be
throwing 0110000, milk, dirt, and stones into his hemely cowl as it hung
down at his back, 110 was 1101 at all moved at it, bnt walked on his way
0110011111 and pleasant3 and what, is he now become so angry and
1001111110111110111111111111
could think on, he thanked him, confessing himself guilty. But 0110
01 the company wondering at such an acknowledgment,—I had done
worse than all thie, says he, unless God’s grace had refrained 1110 How,
then, comes St. Francis now 10 be 00 vindictivel Th. It is so; the
saints, now they 010 in heaven, will take no affront. Was ever any
man gentler than Cornelius, milder than Antony‚ or more patient than
John the Baptist, while they lived upon earthl But now they are in
heaven what dreadful diseases do they send among us, 11 we do not
worship them 00 we should (101 Ph. I am 01 opinion that they
rather cure our diseases than cause them. But, however, assare your·
aelf that what you say to me you say to a man that is neither
profane nora blab.

Th. Well, come on then, depending upon your secrecy‚ Ι will tell
you something relating to this matter. Good St. Francis, 1 entreat
thee and the society that Ι may have your leave to relate what I have
heard. St. Paul, you know, was endowed with ahidden wisdom which
he did not communicate openly, but in private 1ο such as were perfect.
So have the seraphiae also certain mysteries which they do not make
common, but only communicate them in private to certain hlessed
widows, and other choice and godly people, that are well-wishers to the
seraphic society. Ph. I am impatient to hear this triple holy revela·
tion. Th. In the first place, the Lord soretold the seraphic patriarch
that the more the seraphic society increased, the more abundantly He
would make provision for them. Ph. So then, at first dash, here are
those people's mouths stopped who complain that those people grew more
numerous every day that are a burden 10 the public. Th. And secondly,
he discovered this, that annually, upon St. F raucis’s day, all the souls
not only of the brotherhood who wear the holy habit, hut also 01 those
who wish well to that order and are benefactore to the brotherhood,
should be discharged from the fire 01 purgatory. Ph. Why did

as sanriliarly as one friend or companion would with another. God
the Fathcr conversed with Moses, and Moses communicated the law so
delivered to him 10 the people3 Christ published the evangelical law,
and st. Francis delivered two copies of His law that had been written
hy the hand of an angel to the seraphic fraternity.

Ph. Ι want to hear the third revelation. Th. The worthy
patriarch was in 1001 1001 the evil one should corrupt by night the
good seed which had been sown, and the wheat should be rooted up
with the 10100. The Lord likewise freed him from this scruple‚ pro·
