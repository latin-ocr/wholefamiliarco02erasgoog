riest, who had put his money in a large bag in his cassoek, where it
bouged out; he salutes him very civilly, and tells him that he had
orders to buy a surplice, which is the chief vestment used in perform-
ing divine service, for the priest of his parish; he entreats him to
lend him ³a little assistance in this matter, and to go with him to those
that sell 'such attire, that he might fit one according to his siae, because
he was much about the same statmo with the parson of bis parish.
This being but a small kindness‚ the old priest promises to do it very
readily. They go to a certain shop, a sur-plice is ahewn them, the old

im} the sharper viewing the old priest before and behind, likes the
‘surpliee very well, but only found fault that it was too short before.
The selleh, lest he should lose his customer, says, That was nottho

the law. Eut. That saying is not altogether sulse, if by prince you
mean that great⁷prince who was called Oaesar5 and then, if by being
above the law, ‘you mean that whereas others do in some measure keep
