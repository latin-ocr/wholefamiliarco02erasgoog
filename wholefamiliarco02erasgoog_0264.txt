den, 01 which the people say 00 many prodigious things that l can
scaros think likely 10 10 1000. Oy. N ay, there is uoreport 01 11 ean
be so prodigious but that the thing 110011 exceeds it. Me. Why,
then, did you ever enter into 111 09. Yes, Ι 1000 10001011 0000 a lake

muoh to relate 11. 09. I think this 0001000 01 000 discourse hasbeen ¹

prolix enough. 1 am going home to give order to get supper ready,

never saw Romal Me. Ι will tell you 01100 thetmanner I walk about
my house, I go 10 my study, and take care 01 my daughter's chastity3
thence I go into my shop and see what my servants 000 doing, then
iuto the kitchen and see if anything be amisa there ; and so from 000
01000 10 another, what my 0110 and what my children are doing, taking
care that every one bs at his business. These are my Roman 01011000.
09. But St. James would take care 0111000 things for you. Ma The

Holy Scripturas enjoin me to look 01100 them myself, but I do 001 find
any text 10 1000011010 to the saints.
