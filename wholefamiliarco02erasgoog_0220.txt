When I had elamoured a good while, that he would either produce
the horse or the man that bought him, 11001 last pays¹ me down the
money in 0 passion. I had bought him 101 fifteen guineas,I set him 10
him 01 twenty-six, and he had valued him at thirtytwo, and so com-
puted with himself, Ι had better make that profit 01 him than restore
the horso. Ι go away, as 11Ι was vexed in my mind, and scarcely
pacified, though the money was paid me. He desines me not 10 take it
001100, he would make me amends some 011101 way. So Ι bit the hiter.

him the 0010001 should corne and pay him the money 3 but nobody
came, nor ever will corne. Aa. But 10 the meantime, did he never
expostulate the matter with youl Pla With what 1000 01 001001
could he (10 111011 Ι have met him over and over since, and he com-
plained of the uufairness 01 the buyer. But I often reasoned the
matter with him, and told him he deserved 10 be so served, who by
his hasty 001001 him had deprived me 01 my horse. This was a fraud
so well placed, in my opinion, that Ι could not find it in my heart to
confess it 00 0 10011. Au. If Ι had donc such a thing, Ι should have
been so 101 11010 0001000103 11 as a fault, that I should have required a
statue for it. Pb. Icannot tell whether you speak as you think or
not, but you sot me agog, however, to be paying more 01 these fellows

10 their own coin.
