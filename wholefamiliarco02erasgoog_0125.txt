⁵ shall hoppen, you shall bear but half of it, I will take the greatest hals
lllllltlsssllsldy‘lttltltll{tillntlaltlllss libbi
ness of it: and as ior me, if it should be my sate, it would be a pleasure
to me to die in your embrace.

Mo. Men oon bear the missortunes that hoppen according to the
common course of nature better than women ς but I see what a great
deal of grief children bring to some parents by their manners, more
theu following thern to the grave. Pa. To prevent that lies pretty
much in our own power. Ma. How sol Po. Because as to dispo·
sitien good parents commonly have good children, for doves do not
bring kites. Therefore we will do our endeavour to be good ourselves,
and then take care to instruct our children in religion ond piety from
the very cradle. It is of great momentwhat is first infused into them;
and besides, we will take care that ethome they may have good
exemplos of life to imitate. Mo. That you talk of is very hard to
be done. Po. It is hard, because it is good, and for the seme reason
you are hard to be got3 but then we will endeavour the more indus-
triously. Mo. You will find me easy to be wrought upon: do you
see that you form and model mel Pa But only say three words.

Ma. Thetis a very easy metten but words, when they are once
out, cannot be cslled in again. Ι will give you counsel that shall be
better then that for both of us Do you treat with both our parents
that it may be done with their consent. Po. You bid me go e great
way about, end you may satisfy me in three words. Ma Icsnnot
tell whether Ι can or no. Iam not at my own disposal. It was the
custom in old timeto have the consent of parents. The match, in my
opinion, is like to be the more happy if we have our· parents’ consent
to it. Itis your business to court, it is not handsome for us to do
it. We maids love to be forced, though sometimes we love with the
strongest passion. Pe. I shall not think much to coortis you your-
self will not frustrate my endeavours M o. Ipromise you I will not,
my Pamphilus3 donet be discoursged Pa I wish you were not so
scrupuloso. Ma. Do you first endeavour to know your own mind
thoroughly, and don’t be governed by your passion, but by reason.
The passion of love is but temporary, but what proceeds suom reason
islastin .

Peg In truth, you play tho philosopher very prettily, end there-
fore Ι will follow your advice. Ma. You will not repent of your
oondesoension. But, harlr ye, though, herois ono scruple comes into
my mind, that Ι cannot well get over. Pa. Have done with scruples.
Mo. Would you have me marry a dead mant Pa No, but Ishall
oomo to life again then. Ma Well, you have removed my objection.
My Pamphilus, sarowell. Po. Do you take esre of that. Ma Ι
wish you a good night. Why do you sight Pa A good night, say

'ou; Iwish you would give me what you wish me. Mo Scit and
bair, you are a little too hasty. Pa. Must Ι not carry nothing of

you along with met Ma This sweet bell, it will cheer your heart.
Po. But give me s kiss too. Ma No, I have a mind to keep my
maidenhesd for you entire and untouohed. Pa. Will a kiss take
anything from your virginityl Ma Will you give mo leave to lriss
suochunt Pa Nc, by no mosam 1 would have my kisses kept
