that makes a private vow does it with this intention, that if it be eon·
venient he may alter his mind. Βιι. Then might they vow with this
intention that row perpetual chastity. Fi. They ought so to do. Βιι.
Then it would be perpetual and not perpetual. What if it were the ease
of a carthusien monlr that he must either eat meat or diel Whether

Which is the more useful, to sueeour a person in danger of life with
gold and jewels, or with the price of them to sueeour a great many
whose lives ere in danger, and to let the siolr man have a ebieken. Fi.
Ioannot say as to that. Βιι. But the eating of fish or dash is not
of the number of those things that are called substantiale Fi. Let us
leave the carthusians to be their own judge.

Βιι. Let us then talk in the general. sabbath-heeping has been
diligently, frequently, and largely ineulested in the law of Moses. Fi.
True. Bu. Whether then ought Ι to relieve a city in danger, neglect-
ing the sabbath or nott Fi. Do you think me aJew thenl Βιι. Ι
wish you were, and a circumcised one too. Fi. The Lord himself hed
solved that difficulty, saying, the sabbath was made for men, and not
man for the sabbath. Bu. Well, then, is that law of soree in all
human constitutions. Fi. Yes, except anything obstruet. Βιι
What il a lawmalrer make a law, not with this design, that it should
be obligatory upon the pain 0f eternal damnatius, nor indeed unte any
guilt, and to baveno other foree but an exhortationi Fi. Good man,
is it notin the lawmaker’s power how far the law shall be bindingl He
uses his authority in making the law, but as to what it shall obligo to,
and what not, thetis in the hand of ’Gon

Βιι. Why, then, do we hear our parish priests out of the pulpit
crying, “-Tomorrow you must fast, underpain of eternaldamnation,” if
it does not appear to us how far a human law rs bindingl Fi. They
do this that they may in an especiel manner strike terror into the
, contumacious, for 1 presume those words do properly belong to them.
Be. Whether they are a terror to the contumacious I know not: they
throw weak persons into seruples and danger. Fi. lt is a hard matter
to suit both. Βιι. The power of the law and custom are mueh the
same. Fi. Sometimes eustom is the morepowerful. Βιι. They that
introduce aeustom, whether they do it with design of bringing any one
into a snare or not, they ofteutimes bring them into an obligetiou
nolens ιοῐιιιι. Fi. Ι am of your mind Bu. (lustom may lay a ,
burden upoua man when it eannot take it off again. Fi. lt may so.
Βιι. Well, then, now I hope you are sensible how dangerons athmg rt
is to impose new lawe upon men without any necessity or e very great
utility. Fi Ieonfess it.

Βιι. When the Lord says Swear not at all does He render every
onethstswearsobnoxioustothepainsof helll Fi. Ithinlr not Itake
itte beaeounsel and notaeommand. Βιι. But how eanthat be made
clear to my understanding, when He has searee forbid anything with
greater stnetness and severrty than that we swear notl Fi. You must
learn of your tescbers Βιι. When Paul grves edviee, does he oblige to
the painof damnationi Fi. By no means Ba. Why sol Fi. Beeause
he will not east a stumblingblook before the wealr. Βιι. So then it
is in the breest ol the maker of the law to lay liable to damnation or
