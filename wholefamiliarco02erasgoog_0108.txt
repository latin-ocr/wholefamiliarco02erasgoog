THE austaldus BANQUET. 101

not far from Pavia3 the chapel is built from top to buttem, within and
without, of white marhle, and almost all ‚that is init, aa altars, pilleis,
and tombs, are all marble. To what purpose was it to beat such a
vast expense upon a marble temple sor a few solitary monks to sing
inl And itis more burden to them than use too, for they are per..
petually troubled with strangers, that come thither only out of mere
curiosity, to see the marble temple. And that which is yet more
ridiculous, Ι was told there, that there is an endowment of three
thousand dueats a year sor keeping the monastery in repair. And
there are some that think that it is sacrilege to convert a penny of that
money to any other pious uses, contrary to the intention of the
testator, they had rather pull down, that they may rebuild, than not
go on with building. -

I thought meet to mention these, being something more remark-
able thau ordinary, though we have a world of instances of this kind

churches, whereas in times past they 'could hardly get roem lor the
saints there. They must have their images there, and their pictores,
forsooth, with their names at length, their titios, and the inscription of
their donation 3 and this takes up a considerable part of the church ;
and Ι believe in time they will be sor having their eorpse laid even in
the very altars themselves But, perhaps, some will say, would you
have their munificence discouragedl isay no, by no means, provided
what they offer to the temple of God be worthy oi it. But if 1 were
a priest or a hish0p‚I would put it into the heads of those thick-
skulled courtiers or merchants, that if they would atone for their sins
to Almighty God, they should privately bestow their liberality upon
the relies ef the poor. But they reckon all as lost that goes out so by
piace-moal, and is privily distributed toward the succour of the needy,
that the next age shall have no memorial of the hounty. But I think
no money can be better bestowed than that which Christ Himself
would have put to His account, and makes Himself dehtor for.

Ti. Don't you take that hounty to he well placed that is bestowed

for necessarias as should not reaeh to luxury. And I would give
something too, wheresoever I found areligious man that wanted it.
Pi. Many are of opinion that what is given to common beggars is not
well bestowed. Eu. I would do something that way too, hut with
discretiori. But in my opinion, it were better if every city were te
maintain their own poor, and vugahonds and sturdy beggars were not
suffered to strole about, who want work more than money. ri. To
whom then would you in an especial manner givet how muchl
and to what purposesl Eu. It is a hard matter ior me to answer to
all these points exactly. First of all, there should be an inclination to
be helpful to all, and alter that, the proportion must be according to
