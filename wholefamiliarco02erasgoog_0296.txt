Ba. I know some monks so superstitious that they think them?
selves in the jaws of the devil, if by chance they are without their
sacred vestments 3 but they are not at all afraid of his claws while they
are lying, slaudering, drunkening‚ and acting maliciously. Fi. There
are a great many such to be seen among private persons, that cannot
think their house safe from evil spirits unless they have holy wat-er,
holy leaves, and wax tapers; but they are not afraid of them because
(lod is so often offended in them, and the devil served in them. Ba.
How many are there who put more trust in the safeguard of the Virgin
hlary, or St. Christopher, than of Christ himself l They worship the
mother with images, candles, and songs, and offeml Christ heincusly by
their impiousi living. A mariner when in a storm is more ready to
invoke St. Christopher‚ or some one or other of the saints, than Christ
himself. And they think they have made the Virgin their friend, by
singing her in the evening the little song, Salac rapina, though they do
not know what it is they do sing 3 when they have more reason to be
afraid that the Virgin should think they jaer her by their so singing,
when the whole day and great part of the night is spent in obscene
discourses, drunkeuness and such doings as are not fit to be mentioned.

Fi. Ay, and so a soldier, when he is about any dangerous enter·
prise, is ruore ready to remomber Georgo or Barbara than Christ.
And though there is no reverence more acceptable to the saints than
the imitation of their deeds, by which they have approved themselves
to Christ, that is despised as much as can be3 and we fancy that St.
Anthony is mightily attached to us if wo keep some hogs consecrated
to him, and have him painted upon doors and walls with his hog, his
lire, and his bell5 and never fear that which is more to be dreaded, lest
hc should look with an evil eye upon those houses, where those wicked·
uesses reign that the holy man always ahhorred. Do we say over
rosarias and salutatione to the hely Virginl we should rather recount
to her the humiliationes our pride, the repressing ourlusts, the forgiv-
iug of injurias. The mother of Christ takes more dclight in such songs
as these, and these are the offioes that obligs them both.

Bu. Α man that is siok is more ready to remember St. Rochus or
Dionysius than Christ, the only health of mankind; and more than
that, they that from the pulpit interpret the holy scripturas, which
none without the assistance of the Spirit can rightly understand or
profitably teach—they choose rather to invoke the aid of the Virgin
Mary than of Christ or his Spirit. And he is suspected for a heretie
that dares to mutter against this austum, which they call laudable. But
the custom of the ancient fathers was much more laudable, such as
Origen‚ Basil, Chrysostom‚ Cypriam, Ambrose, Jerome, and Austin
used, who often inroked Christ’s Spirit, but never implored tho aid of
'the Virgin. But they are not at all displeased at them who have
presumed to alter so holy a cuntem, taken from the doctrine of Christ
and the apostles‚ and the examples of holy fathers.

Fi. Α great many monks are guilty of such like errors, who
persuade themselves that St. Benedict ismightily attached to them if
they wear his cowl and cloak3 though I do not believe he ever wore
one so full of folds, and that eost so much money ; and they are not
afraid of his anger, in that they do not imitate him in his life at all.

Ba He is every good son of St Francis who does not disdain to
