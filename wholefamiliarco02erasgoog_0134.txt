'THE UNEASY WIFE.

THE UNEASY WIFE.
Eulaliaxmwippe.

. Εο. Most weloome,Xantippe; a good morning to you. Χο. Ι
wish you the same, my dear Eulalia. Methinks you look prettier than
you use todo. Eo. What, do you begin to banter me alreadyl X a.
No, upon my word, sor you seem so to me. En. Perhaps, then, my
new clothes may set me off to advantage. Xa. You guess right ; it is
one of the prettiest suits Ι ever beheld in all my life. Itis English
cloth, I suppose. Eo. It is indeed oi English wool, but it is a
Venetian dye. Xa. It is as aoft as silk, and it is a charming purple.
Who gave you this fine presenti aa. My husband. From whom
should a virtuous wife receive presente from but srom himl

Xo. Well, you are a happy woman, that you are, ιο have such a
good husband. For my part, I wish Ι had been married to a mosh-
room when 1 was married to my N iok. Ea. Why so, prayl What,
is it come to an open rupture between you already? X ο. Tharais
no possibility of agreeing with such a one as Ι have got. You see
what a ragged condition 1 am in ; so he lets me go like a dowdy.
May Ι never stir is Ι am not ashamed to go out os doors any whither
whenI see how fine other women are, whose husbands are nothing ·
nigh so rich as mine is.

Eu. The ornament oi a matron does not consist in fine clothes or
other deckings of the body, as the apostle Peter teuchos, for Ι heard
that lately in a sermon ; but in chaste and modest behaviour, and the
ornaments of the mind. Whores are tricked up to take the eyes of ,
lmany, but we are well enough dressed if we do but plesse our own
usbands. ·

X a. But, meanwhile, this worthy tool of mine, that is so sparing
toward his wife, lavishly squanders away the portion I brought along
with me, which, hy the way, was not a mean one. Eo. In whatl
Χο. Why, as the maggot bites, sometimes at the tavern, sometimes
upon his whores, sometimes agaming. Eu. Oh, fielyou should never '
say so of your husband. X ο. But Ι am aure it is too truej and then
when he comes home, aiter I have been waiting for him till Ι do not
know what timeat night, as drunk aa David's sow, he does nothing
but lie snoring all night long by my side, and sometimes bespews the
bed too, to say nothing more. Eu. Hold your tangue. You disgraoe
yourseli in disgracing your husband. Χο. Lat me die if l had not
rather lie with a swine than such a husband as Ι have got.

Ea. Don't you scold at him thenl Xa. Yes; indeed, I use him
as he deserves. He finds I have got a tongue in my head. Ea.
well, and what does he say ιο you againl Xa. At first he used to
hector at me lustily, thinking ιο srighten me with his big' words.
Ilo. Well, and did your words never come to downright blowsl Xa.
Once, and but once, and then the q'uarrel rose to that height on both
aidesthat wawere within an ace os going to fisticuffs. Eu. How,
woman, say you sol Xa. Heheld up his stick at me, swearing and
, cursing like a footsoldier, and threatening me dreadiully. Eo. Were
you not afraid thenl Χο. Nay,I snatohed up a threelegged stool,
