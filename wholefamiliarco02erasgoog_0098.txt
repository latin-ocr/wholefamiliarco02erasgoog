THE RELIGIOUS BANQUET. 91 ·

own Master he stands or falls. He thetis spiritual judgeth 01 011
things, but he himself ,is judged of no mam' ’' To such, therefore, let
no man prescribe5 101 the Lord who hath appointed bounds to the
aeas and rivers, hath the heart 01 Η10 king in His hand, and inclines
it which way soever it pleases Him. What need isthere to prescribe
to him that does 01 his own accord better things than human laws
oblige him tol Or, how great a rashness were it to bind that person
by human constitutions who, it is manifest, by evident tokens‚is
directed hythe inspiratione of the Holy Spirit. Eu. OTimothy‚
Ἴ thou hast not only got grey hairs on this head, but you have likewise 11
mind venerable for experimental knowledge. And 1 would to God
that we had more such kings as this king of yours among Christiana,
who, indeed, all of them ought to be such. But we have dwelt long
enough upon our eggs and herbs; let them be taken away, and some-
thing else set in their room. Ti. We have done so well already on this
ovation‚ that there is no need of any more, either of supplication or
triumph. But since, by God’s assistance, we have succeeded so well
in the first verse, Ι wish your umbra would explain the other, which
seems to me a little more obscure.

Soph. 11 you will put a good construction upon what Ι shall say,
I will give you my thoughts upon it. How else can a shadow pretend
to give light to anythingl Eu. I undertake that for all the com-
pany3 such shadows as you give as much light as our eyes will well
bear. Sopb. The same thing seems to be meant here tha-t St. Paul
says-“That there are several ways 011110 that lead 1ο]101111000.”
Some allect the ministry, some celibacy, others a married state3 some
a retired life, others public administrations of the government, accord-
ing to the various dispositione of their bodies and minda. Δ13011110
one man all meats are indifferent, another puts a difference betwixt
this meat and that; another he makes 0 difference 01 days, another
thinks every day alike. In these things St. Paul would have every
one enjoy his own freedom ο1 mind, without reproaching another, nor
should we censure any man in those cases, but leave him to be judged
by Him that weigbeth the beart. It ostentimes happens that he that
eata may be more acceptable to God than 110 that lorbears3 and he
that breaks 0 hely-day than he that seems to observo it ; and he that
marries 10 more acceptable to God than a great many that live single
Ι, who am but a abadon, bave spoken my mind.

Eu. Iwish Ι could have conversation with such shadows osten
I think you have hit the nail on the head. But here is one that has
lived a bachelor, and not 01 the number of saints who have made
themselves eunucha, bnt was made so for the sake 01 the kingdom 01
God, by force to gratify our bellies (“ till God shall destroy both them
and meats.'’) It is 0 capon 01 my own leading. Iam 0 great lover 01
boiled 1110010. This isa very good soup, and these are choico lettuces
that 010 111 it. Pray every one help himself to what he likes best But
that you may not be deceived, Ι tell you that we have a course 0110001
coming, and 0110111101 some small dessert, and οο conclude.

Pi. But we exclude your wile from table Eu. When you bring

your own wives mine shall keep them company. She would, 11 she
