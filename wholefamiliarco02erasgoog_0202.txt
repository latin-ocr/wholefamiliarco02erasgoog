THE Assos AND THE LEABNED WOMAN. 195

¹of her famil and to instruct her childrenl Ant Yes it is M
l And do youhhink so weighty an office can be executed wiihoutwisdohql
Ant. Ι believe not. May. This wisdom I learn from books.
2 Ani. I have threescore and two monks in my cloister, and you will
ῑ not see one book in my chamber. May. The monks are finely looked
‘aster all this,while. Ant. I could dispenso with books, but Ι cannot
‘bear Latin books. Mag. Why sol Ant. Because that ronoue'a not
lfit for a woman. Mag. I want to know the reasong Ant. Because it
contributas nothing towards the defense of their chas ity. Moy. Why
then do French books that are stuffed with the most trifling novels
contributa to chastityl Aret. But there is another reason. May. Lot
it be what it will, tell me it plainly. Aut. They ars more securo from
the priests, if they do not understand Latin. Mag. N ay, there is the
least danger from that quarter, according to your way of working,
because you take all the pains you cau not to know anything of Latin.
⁴ Ant. The common people are of my mind, because it is such a rare
unusual thing for a woman to understand Latin. May. What do you
trll meos the common people for, who are the worst examples in the
· world that can be followedl What have Ι to do with custom, that is
the mistress of all evil practicesl We ought to accustom ourselves to
the best things, and by that means, that which was uncustomary would
become habitual, and that which was unplcasant would become pleasant,
pud that which seemed unbecoming would look graceful. 'Ant I
rear ou.
dllcp. Is it becoming a German woman to learn to speak Frenchl
alut. Yes it is. Moy. Why is itl Ant. Because then she will be'
able to converse with those that speak French. May. And why theu
is it unbecoming in me to learn Latin that Ι may be able daily to have
conversation with so many eloquent, learned, and wise authors, and
faithful counsellorsl Ant. Books destroy women's hrains, who have
little enough of themselves. ling. What quantity of brains you have
left I cannot tell. And as for mysell, let me have never so little, I had
rather spend them in study than iu prayers mumbled over without the
heart going along with them, or sitting whole nights in quaffing off
humpers. Ant. Bookishness makes folks mad. May. And does not
‘the rattle of your pot companions, your banterers, and drolls make you
madl ,lut No, they pass the time away. Meg. How can it be,
then, that such pleasant companions should make me madl Ant.
Tlrat is the common sayiug. Mag. But I by experienoo lind quite
the contrary. How many more do we see grow mad by hard drinking,
umseasonable feasting, and sitting up all night tippling, which destroys
the constitution and senses, and has made people madl Ant. By my
saith, Iwould not have a learned wife. May. But Ι bless myself
that I have got a husband thetis not like yourself. Learning both
endears him to me and me to him. s Ant. Learning costs a great deal
of pains to get, and after all we must die.
Mag. N otabls sir, pray tell me, suppose you were to die tomorrow,
had you rather dio a fool or a wise manl Ant. Why, a wiso man, if
1 could como at it without taking pains. May. But there is nothing
to be attained in this life without pains3 and yet, let us get what we
will, and what paine soever we are at to attain it, we' must leave it
behind us. Why then should we think much to be at some pains lor
