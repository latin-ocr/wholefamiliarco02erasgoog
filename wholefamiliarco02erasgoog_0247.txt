A merchant that is going a voyage to Spain io get pelf reeom-
mends to me the chastity of hie kept mistress ; and a professed nun,
having thrown away her veil in order to make her escape, recommends
to me the care of her reputation, which she at the same time intende
to prostitute. The wickcd soldier, who butchers men for money, bawla
out to me with these words, 0 blessed Virgin, send me rich plunder.
The gamester calls out to me to give him good luck,andpr0mises1
shall go snips with him in what he shall win, and if the dice do not
favour, I am railed at and ou-rsed because I would not be a confederata
in his wickedneas. The usurer prays, Help me to large interest for my
money, and if Ι deny them anything they cry out I am no mother of
merc .

ilud there is another sort of people whose prayers are not properly
so wicked as they are foolish. The maid prays, Mary, give me a hand·
some, rich husband ; the wife ories, Give ine fine children ; and the
woman with child, Give me a good delivery. The old woman prays to
live long without a cough and thirst 3 and the doting old man, Send
· that Ι may grow young again. The philosopher says, Give me the

' faculty of starting difficulties never to be resolved; the priest says,

Give mesfat benefico; the bishop cries out for the saving of his
diocese, and the mariner for a prosperous voyage ; the magistrate eries
out, Shew me thy Son before 1 die; tho courtier, that he may make an
effectual confession when at the point of death ; the husbandmen calls ·
on me for sessonable rain, and a sarmer's wife to preserve her sheep
and cattle. If Ι refuse them anything, then presently Ι am hard-
hearted. If Ι refer them to my Son they cry, lf you will but say the
word, Iam 11111 He will do it How is it possible for me a lone body,
a woman, and a virgin, to assist sailors, soldiers, merchants, gamesters‚
brides and bridegrooms, women in travail, princes, kings, and peasantsl
And what I have mentioned is the least part of what I suffer.

But I am much less troubled with these concerns now than I have
been, for which I would give you my hearty tlranks, if this conveniency
did not bring a greater inconvenieney along with it. Ihave indeed
more leisure, but less honour and less money. Before I was saluted
queen of the heavcns and lady· of the world, but now there are very
few from whom I hear an Ave Mary. Formerly I was adorned with
jewels and gold, and¹ had abundance of changes of apparel: I had
presente made me of gold and jewels ; but now Ihave scarce half a vest
to cover me, and thetis meuse-caten too. And my yearly ravenue is
soarce enough to keep alive my poor sexton, who lights me up a little
wax or tallow oandle.

But all these things might be borne with, if you did not tell us
that there were greater things going forwerd. They say you aim at
this, to strip the altars and temples of the saints everywhere. 1 advisa

you again and again to have 1 care what you do, for other saints do
