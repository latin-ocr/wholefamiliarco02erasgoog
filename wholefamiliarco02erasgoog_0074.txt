Tse* PROFANE BANQUET. 67

ol. No, before they had drank one drop. But Ι havea mind to hear
your opinion, who are a man of great skill in these matters

Au. Our countryrnen prefer white before red, because the red isa
little more upon the aeid, and the white a smaller wine; but that is
the milder, and in my opinion themora wholesome. We have a pale
red wine, and a yellow wine, and a purple colour wine. This ie new
wine, this year's wine This istwo years old. If anybody is for un
old wine, we have some four years old, but it is grown flat and dead
with age. The strength is gone with age. Au. Why, you are as
rich as Lucullus.

ol. Soho, boy, where are you a loiteringl You give us no
attendance3 don't you see we have no wine here. What if a fire
should huppen nowl how should we put it outl (live every one a
full lass.

8(ΙΙΙ What is the matter that you are not merryl What makes
you sit so melanclroly l What is the matter with you, that you are not
cheersull You are either troubled at something, or you are making
verses. You play the Crysippus now, you want a Melissa to seed you.

Aa. What story is this you are telling me ol l Ol. Crysippus is '

reported to have been so intent upon his logical subtilties, thet he
would have been starved at table, unless his maid Melissa had put the
meat into his mouth. Aa. He did notdeserve to have his life saved ;
but is silence is an offense to you, and you love a noisy least, you have
gotten that will make one. dt. Ι rernember Ι have. That is very
well minded: we must drink more freely, we ought to drink more
largely, more wine and less water.

You nave mr ou rnre Minna-Ae. -You have hit the nail on
the head. You are in the right. You have hit the mark. For

Foeoundi calices quem non fecere disertuml

Cle. 'I'hat is very learnedly spoken, Aust'rn, and so indeed is all
that comes from you ; but since we are fallen into a discourse con·
oerning wine, since we have happened to make mention os wine, I have
a mind to usk you, lor what reason the ancients, who will have Bacchus
the inventor ol wine, call him the god ol the poetsl What has that
drunken god tc do with the poete, who are the votaries of the virgin
mvreesl Aa By Bacchus, this isaquestion fit to be put overabottle.
But 1 see very well what your question drives at. ol. What, pritheel
Aa Yon-very cunningly put a question about wine, by a French
trick which Ibelieve yon learned at Paris, that you may save your
wine by that means. Ab, go your way ; I see you are a sophist; you
have mades good proficiency in that school. ol.. Well,l take all
your jehes3 1 will return the like to you when opportunity shall offer.
But to the matter in hand. Aa. I will go on, but 1 will drink first, lor
it is absurd to disputa about a tippling question with a dry thrcat.
Hereis to you, Christian Half this cup to you. Ch. I thank you
kindly, (lod blesa it tc you, much good may it do you.

Aa. Now 1 am ready, at your servies. l will do it as well as I
