336 FAMILIAB COLLOQUIES.

Ἰ what greum obscurity there is in the primitive origin of words. And
besides, there is nothing contradictory in the matter, if you look
narrowly into it. The talus is voluble‚ but it is voluble after such a
manner that it rendere that part to which it is inserted the ruore firm
101 standing, and then it joius oue bone to another. Qu. 1 lind you
can play the part of a sophist when you have a mind to it. Ol. But
there is nothing in the word tulus thet the etymology 01 11 should

perplex us, sor that which the modern ¹Greeks cell ἆστρᾶγαλος, the
senciente, 01 which Callimachus was one, called dorprov, to whom this
hemistich is ascribed, Aisa δ’ ἆστριο duero λύτρον; whence, as the
Greeks used the word ἁστραγολίζειν, so they also used the word
ἆστρίζειν, to play at oockal.

Qu. What then is that which is properly tho talusl Ol. It is

that which now-a-duys the girls pley with; it uras formerly a boy's
pley, as oob-nuts was3 concerning which there is this Greek sentence,

'App' ἀστραγάλοισι χολωθεὶς, when they would intimate that persons
were angry 101 0 tritle. Again, Horace in his Odes has Nee regum 11111
sortiere 10110. And also in his Sermones, Te &clos Aule neceque, de.
And lastly, that saying 01 the Lacedcmoniun‚ 11 1 am not mistaken,
Pueros csse folleradus telis, viros jurejurando. They deny that the talus

is found in any animal thet is μουυχον, that is, that has a solid hocf,

except the Indian ass, thet hos but one horn; or that is πολυχιδὲς,
thet has its 1001 divided into many toes or claws; of which sort are the
lion, the panther, the dog, the ape, a man, a bird, eud e great many
others. But those animale that arc δίχηλα, that have a hoof divided
into two, many of them have the tuhw, and that, as you said very
rightly, in their hinder lege. Mau only has not the talus, sor two
russeum-first, because he is two-footed3 and secondly, because his
1001 is divided into live toes.

Qu. That I have heard often ; but I should be glad to bear where
the talus was situated, and whut form it has described ; 101 that sort of
play is quite out of doors with boys newa-days and they rather effect
dice, carde, and other masculine plays. Cle. 'shut is not to bc wondered
at, when they affect divinity itself. But 11 I were a mathenratician, or
a painter, or s founder, 1 could not represent it more cleerly to you
than by showing you the talus itsell', unless you would have me
describe it algebraicelly, as they do. Qu. Have you got ever a talusl
ot, Here is one out 01 the right leg of a sheep ; you sco it has but
four sides, when a cube end a dioc has six, four on the sides, one at
the top, end one at the bottorn. Qu. It is so. Ob. And forosrnueh
as the upper und lower part 01 the talus is crooked, ithae but four
sides, oue 01 which, you see, risos likc a ridgc. Qu. Iscc it. Oh,

011 the opposite side there is a lrollow; this Aristotle calls πρανὲς,

thetis, prone, and this ὕπτιον, thetis, supine: as when iu the act 01
copulation, 101 the sake 01 procreation‚ the women is supine and the
man is prone. And the hand, if the palm of it hc held towards the
ground, is prone, 11 you turn it up it is supine 3 though oratore and
poete do sometimes confound she use 01 these words, but thet is
nothing to the matter in hand.

Qu. Yon have demonstrated this very plainly to my sight; but
what is the dill'orenoe between tho two other sidesl Oe. One 01 thom
