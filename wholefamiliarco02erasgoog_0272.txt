and charity, why was the burden of the law taken away irem them, es
from persons weak‚ and in danger, under an unoqual yokel Why did
Peter by the inspiration οι the Spirit call it an intolerable burdenl

Fi. It was taken away on one part, lest Judaism, as it had begun,
should overwhelm the glory οι the gospel, aud lest the Gentiles, by
thet s tumblingblock οι the law, should be alienated from Christ ,among
whom there were many weak persons, who were in a double danger-
0n the one hand, lest they should believe there was no salvation to be
had without the observetion οι the law; and on tho other hand, lest
they should rather choose ιο remain in paganism, than take upon them
the yoke οι the Mosaic law. It was necessary to allure these weak
minda, as it were, with a hait of liberty. Secondly, That thoy might
heal them who denied there was any hope οι salvation by the profes·
sion οι the gospel without the observation οι the law, circumcision,
sabbatha, and the choico οι meets, and other things οι that kind ,they
either wholly took away, or changed into something else. And besides,
whereas Peter denies that he was ableto bear the burden οι the law, it
isnot to be understood οι him as to the person he then bare, when
there was nothing unbearable to him, butes the stupid and weak Jews, .
who, though they were cloyed with it, fed upon the husk, not having
any relish of the Spirit.

Bu. Yon argue, indeed, very smartly; but for all that, ιιι my
opinion, even at this day, there is no less reason why those carnal

. obligations that ere arhitmry, and not obligatory, should be taken away.

Fi. Wh sol

Ray I lately saw the whole world described in a large map 3 from
thence I learned how small a part οι the world it was thet truly and
sincerely professed the Christian religion. One small pert οι Europe
to the east, and another towards the north ; the third inclining towards
the south, but reaching but a little way ; and the fourth pert, which is
Poland, inclining towards the east. All the rest οι the world is either
possessed by barbarione or such as differ but very little. from brute
beasts 3 or schismatica, or heretice, or> both. Fi. But did you not mind
the southern shore, and the Christian islanda that lay scattered about
itl Bu. I saw them, and learned that there were great spoils brought
out οι thom, but no Christianity carried into them. When, indeed,
when there is so plentiful a harvest, it seems most advisable for the
propagation οι the Christian religion ιο do as the epostle did, who took

away the burden οι the Mosaic law, lest the Gentiles should fall back, ·

so now to allure the weak, the obligations ιο some ceremonies should
be removed, without which the world was saved in the beginning, end
may now, if it hath saith and gospel charity.

Again, 1 both hear and see many who place religion in places,
garments, meets, fests, gestures, and songs, and for the sake οι these
things judge their neighboure contrary to the precept οι the gospel
From whence it cemes to pass, that whereas saith and charity consti·
tute the Christian religion, they are botht ex tinguished by those super·
stitione. For he' rs far from the saith οι the gospel who depende upon
these acts; and he is far from Christian charity who ior the sake οι
meat ordrink, which a person may lawfully use, exasperates his brother, ⁸
ιοι whose liberty Christ died. What bitter contentione do we see
among Christiane? What spiteful calumnier upon anone οι a gur·
