THE OLD MEN'S oratorius. 177

think myself what course of life to choose, which Ι thought to be a matter
of great importance as to my future happiness ; so I cast my thoughts
about what had been successful to some, and what had been unsucccss·
ful to others.¹ Pol admira you had so much prudence, when you

must know, I did not do all this neither ,of my own mother-wit. Po.
Indead Istood in admiration. Gt. BeforeI engaged inanything, I
applied to a certain citizen, a man of gravity, of the greatest prudente
by long experience, and of a general reputation with his fellowcitizens,
and lin my opinion the most happy man in the world. Ea. You did
wrse y.

Gt. By this man’s advice I married a wife. Po. Had she a very
good portionf ol. An indifferent good one, ancl according to the
proverb, in a competent propert-ion to my own. For I had just enough

todo my business, and this matter succeeded to my mind. Po. What .

was your age thenl Gt. Almost two and twenty. Po. Ohappy man!
Gt. But do not mistake the matter, all this was not owing to fortune
neither. Po. Why sol sl. I will tell you, some love before they
choose, Imade my choico with judgment first, and then loved afterwards,
and nevertheless ‘I married this woman more for the sake of posterity
than for any carnal satisfaction. With her I lived a very pleasant life,
but not above eight years. Po. Did she leave you no childrenl Gt.
Nay, I have four alive, two sons and two daughters.

Po. Do you live as a private person, or in some public officel
Gt. Ι have a public employ. I might have happened to have got into
a higher post, but I chose this because it was credible enough to
secure me from contempt, andis free from troublesome attendanoe.
And it is such that nobody need object against me that I live only
for myself; Ihave also something to spare now and then to assist a
friend. With this I live content, auditis the very height of my
ambition. And then l have taken care so to execute my office, to
give more reputation to my officcthan I received from it; this Ι ’
account to be more honourable than to borrow my dignity from the
splendour of my office. Eu. Without all controversy. Gt By this
means I am advanced in years and the affectione of my fellowcitizens
Eu. But that is one of the most difficult things iu the world, when
with very good reason there is this old saying ε He that has no enemies
has no friends; and, envy is always an attendant on felicity.

Οἱ. Envy always is a concomitant of a pompous felicity, but a
mediocrity is safe; this was always my study, not to make any advan-
tage to mysell' from the disadvantages of other people. I embraced as
much as I could that which the Greeks call freedom from the cucum-
brance of business. I intermoddled with no one’s affairs 3 but especially
I kept myself clear from those that could not be meddled with without ,
gaining the ill will of a great many. If a friend wants my assistance, Ι
so serve him as theroby not to procure any enemies to myself. In
eise os any misunderstanding between me and any persons, I endeavour
to soften it by clearing myself of suspicion, orto setall right again by

good offioes, or to let it die without taking notice of it. I always avoid
contention3 but, if it shall happen, Ι had rather lose my money than
my friend Upon the whole, Ι act the part of Mitio in the comedy,·-·
