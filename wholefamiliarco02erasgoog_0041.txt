between you and Ι 10 11100000011, but that which 10 11 my power-1
will do. Iwill be thankful as long 10 Ι 1110. Iconfcss mysclf highly
obliged 1ο 101 101 your good service. For this kindness Ι owe you
more than I am able to pay. By this good office you have attached
me to you 00 firmly that I can never be ableto disengago myself.
You have laid me under so many and great obligations that I shall
never be able to get out 01 your debt. No 01110 was ever so engaged
in duty to his master as you have engaged me by this office. Yon
have by this good turn brought me moro into your debt thau everI
shall be able to pay. Iam obliged 10 you upon many accounts, but
upon none moro 111111 upon this. Thanks aro due 101 common kind-
ness, but this is beyond the power of thanks 10 1011111110.

I had been wanting 10 my friend. Whatsoover Ι hare, and whatsoever
Ι can do, you may eall as much your own as anything that you have

the best title to. Ι look upon it as a favour that you take my service ·

kindly. You pay 00 great an acknowledgment to mc for so 0110110
kindness, as though I did not owe you much greater. He serves him-
self that 001100 1110 friend. He that 0011001 friend does not give
away his 0011100, bnt puts 11011 10 interest. If you approve 01 my
service. pruy make frequent 100 01 11; then I shall think my service 10
