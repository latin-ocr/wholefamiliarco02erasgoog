'268 FAMILIAR destoueles

I will tell you in brief. Ι would so demean myself that the whole
world should see that there was 0 11111100 01 the church that aspired
after nothing but the glory 01 Christ and salvation 01 mankind. That
would insallibly take away all invidiousness from the name 01 pope,
and gain him solid and lasting glory. But, by the way, 110111 worse 10
better. We have digressed from our first proposition. Bu. Well,I
will bring you to rights again by and by. But do you say, then, that
the pope's laws are binding to 1110 whole churcbl Fi. Ido say so.
Bu. What! to the punishment 01 110111 Fi. They say so. Bu.
And are the bishops' laws obligatory in like mannerl Fi. Ithink
they are, every one in his own diocese. Bu. And 111000 01 abbots
1001 Fi. Iam in doubt 00 10 that ; 101 they receive their adminis-
tration upon certain conditione, nor have any power 10 burden their
inferiore with constitutions without the concurrenee of the whole
order. Bu. But what 11 0 bishop receive his sunction upon the same
conditionsl Fi. I doubt as to that.

Bu. Cantha pope annul what a bishop has constitutedl Fi.
Ibelieve he can. Bu. Can nobody annul what the pope decreesl
Fi. No, nobody. Bu. How comes it about that we hear 01 the
resuming 01 popes’ constitutions under this title, that they have not
been rightly instructed, and that the constitutions 01 former popes
have been antiquated by later, as deviating from pietyl Fi. These
were surreptitious and temporary things ; 101 the pope, considered as
0 man, may be ignorant 01 11010011 and 1001. But that which proceeds
110111 1110 authority 01 an universal council is a heavenly 010010, and is
01 equal authority with the gospel itself, or at least very near it. Bu.
Is it lawful 10 doubt concerning the gospelsl Fi. By no means; no,
11011110 00111101101101111011111111111 assembled by the Holy spirit, carried
1101111111 ttulistis ⁸0 1111111111111111111101111
council at Basil, which hasbeen rejected hy some; nor (10 011 approve
0111101 oiConstance I speak of those that are accounted'ortbodox‚
not to mention the late Lateran eouncil. Fi. Let them that will
doubt at their own peril. 1 will 1101 doubt sor my part.

Bu. Had Peter, then, the authority 01 making new lawsl Fi.
Hc had. Bu. And had Paul too, and the rest 01 the apostlesl Fi.
Yes, they had every one in their own ehurches committed 10 them by
Peter or Christ. Bu. And have the 0000000010 01 Ρο101 s like
authority with Peter himself 1 Fi. Why 11011 Ba. And isthere
the same regard 10 be had to the 110110 01 Rome’s letter as 10 the
Epistlc 01 St. Peter himself, and as much 10 the constitutions 01 1110110110
ss 10 the Epistles 01 St. Pauli Fi. Ν ay,I think, and more 100. is
they command and make it 0 law by authority. Bu. ls it lawful to
doubt whether Peter end Paul wrote by the inspiration 01 the Holy
Spiritl Fi. N sy, let him be accounted an heretic that doubts 0111101

Ba. And do you think the same of the ordinances end constitu-

tions 01 the popes and bishopsl Fi. Ido as to the popes, butI should
nrske some question as 10 1110 bishops, but that it seems 0 part 01 piety
not to be suspicions 01 any person unless there be very good grounds
101 it. Ba. But why will the Holy 011010110100111011100111011101
than a popel Fi. Because that error is the most dangerous that pro .
eeeds from the head. Bu. If the constitutions 01 prelates are 01 such
