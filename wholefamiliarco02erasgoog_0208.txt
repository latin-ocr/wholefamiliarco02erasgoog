clear day, and 001 00 much as a cloud to be 0000 thera Polus, looking

the eross, and having composed his countenanee to an air of 001000·

rode next 10 him asking him what it was that he saw, he fell again to
signing himself with a greater crosa. May the most merciful God,
says he, deliver me from this prodigy. They having urged him,
desiring to know what was the matter, he 111103 his eyes up to heaven,
and pointing with his 11030110 a certain quarter 01 11, Do you not see,
says he, that monstrous dragon armed with fiery horus, and 1101011
turned up in a 0110101 And they denying they saw it, he bid them
look earnestly, every now aud then pointing 10 the place. At last one
01111010, that he might not seem 10 be bad-sighted, affirmed that he
saw it. And in imitation of him, first one, and then another, for they
were ashamed that they could not 000 what was 00 plain 10 be seen. ι
And in short, in three days’ time the rumour of this portentous appa· 1· 1,
rition had spread all over England. And it is wonderful 10 think how , ‚¹
popular fame had amplified the story, and some pretended seriously to⁴
expound to what this portent did predict, and he that was the con·

rto. Iknow the humour of the man well enough. But to the story
of the apparition.

Latin they call regulare, hut that is not enough, unless they add the
semein Greek too, who was parson of 0 neighbouring parish, this man
thought himself wiser than 10001001010000001011)1 in holy matters),
came very opportunely to pays visit to Polus. Tho. Iunderstand
the matter. There is 000 found out to be 011 00101 10 11110 play. filas.
At supper 0 (1100011100 was raised of the repert of this apparition, and
when Polus perceived that Faunus had not only heard of the repert,
but believed it, he began to 0011001 the man, that as he was a holy and
a learned person, he would afford 00100 101101 10 0 poor soul that was
in such dreadful torment. And, says he, if you are in any doubt as 10
the truth of it, examine into the matter, and do but walk nearthat

hunting 01 fowling. And when it. grew duskish‚ the darkness having
taken away all opportunity of making any certain judgment of any-

Polus having hid himself in a bramble hedge hard by, had very art

being impatient 10 1011 what he had heard. Polus, taking a shorter way,
had got home before him. Faunus up and tells Polus all that passed,
and added something cf his own to it, to make the matter more
wonderful. Tho. Gould Polus keep his countenanee in the 0000111001
