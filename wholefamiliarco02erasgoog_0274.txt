ICHTHl'OPHAGIA; 012, arse-EATINe. 267

Fi. I consessit, and aeknowledge it to be true. Bu. But do you ·
think it lit that because of the contentione and delays of lawyers in
relation to contracts, the whole world should be kept in paint For

aa matters are now, there is no safety anywhere, and the woret of
men take advantage of the opportunity, while there is neither peace

nor war.

Fi. It is not my business to determine concerning the eounsels of
princes But if 1 were Caesar, Iknow what Ι would do. Bu. well,
come on, then, you shall be Oaesar, end the pope too, if you plesse. “
What isit you would dot Fi. Ihad rather be emperor and king ef
Frauce. Bu. Well, let it be so, you shall be both of them then. Fi.
I would immediately take upon me a vow of peace, and publiaha truce
throughout my dominicus, dieband my forces, and make it a capital
crime sor any to touch so much as a heu that was not their own So
having settled affairs to my conveniency, or rather that of the public,
Iwould treet eoneerning the limite of my dominion, or the eon-
ditions of a match. Be. Have you projeeted any firmor ties than
those of matrimonyl Fi. Ithink Ι have. Bra Let us hear them.

Fi. Were I emperor, 1 would without delay thus treet with the
king of France :—“ My brother, some evil spirit has set this war on
foot between you and me 3 nor do we fight for our lives, but our
dominions You, as to your part, have behaved yourself as a stout
aud valiant warrior 3 but fortune has been on my side, and oi a king
made you a captive. What has been your lot may be mine, and your
mishap admonishes all of our human condition. We have experienced
that this way ef contentiori hasbeen detrimental to both of us, let us
engage one another after a different manner. Igive you your life,
and restore you your liberty, and instead oi an enemy take you sor my
friend. Let all past animosities be sorgotten, you are at free liberty
to return into your own dominicus, enjoy what is your own, be a good
111111111111111111111111111111ῗῖ11111
one with another which shall govern the largest dominions, but who
shall govern his own with the greatest justice and goodness. In the
former conflict Ι have bore away the prize of fortune, but in this he
that gete the better shall gain sar more glory. As for me, the fame of
this clemency will get me more true glory than is 1 had added all
France to my dominion ; and in you a grateful mind will he more te
your praise than if you had drove me quite out of Italy. Do you not
euvy me the praiee that I am ambitious of, and I will on the other
hand carry mysels toward you, that you shall willingly owe an obliga·
tion to so good a friend.'’

Be. In truth, not only all Franco but all the world might he
attached by this method. For if this uleer should huppen to be
ekinued over, rather than thoroughly healed by unequal terme, Ι am
afraid that upon the first opportunity, the skin being broken, abundance
oi corrupt matter would issue out, and that with more dangeroue con-
sequences. Fi How great and glorious would this aet of humanity
render Oharles all over the worldl What naticn would not readily
submit to so genereus and kind a prineel

Ba. Yon have acted the part of the emperor very well : now act
the pope too. Fi. It would be too long to go through everything.
