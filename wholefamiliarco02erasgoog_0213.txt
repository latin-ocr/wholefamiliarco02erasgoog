206 FAMILIAR comoedias

THE ALCHEMJST.

Phileoosts, Laius.
Pa What news is here that Laius laugha to himself so that he

even giggles again, every now and then signing himself with the sign
of the crossi Iwill mterrupt his felicity. God bless you heartily, my
very good friend Laius, you seem to me to be very happy. La. But
Ishall be much happier if I make you a pertaker of my merry con·
certedness. Pl. Prithee, then, make me happy as soon es you can.

· La. Do you know Balbinusl Pa. What, that learned old gentleman

that has such a very good character in the world. La. lt is as you
sey; but no man iswise at all times, or iswithout his blind side. This
man, among his many good qualifications, has some foibles: he has
been a long time bewitched with the ert called alchemy. Pa. Believe
me, thet you call only foiblo is adangerous disease. La. However
that is, notwithstanding he had beon so often bitten by this sort of
poople‚ yet he has lately suffered himself to he imposed upon again.
Pa. In what mannerl

La. A certain priest went to him, saluted him with great respect,
and accosted him in this manner: Most learned Balbinus, perhaps you
will wonder that I, being a sti-anger to you, should thus interrupt you,
who, Ῑ know, are always eornestly engaged in the most sacred studies
Balbinus gave him a nod, as was his custom, for he is wonderfully
sparingofhiswords. Pla. Thatisan argument of prudence. ha But
the other, es the wiser of the two, proceeds. You will forgive this my

says he, as briefly as Ι am able. You know, most learned of men, that
the fetes of mortale are various ; and Ι cannot tell among which Ι
should class myself, whether among the happy or the miserebis, for
when I contemplate my fate on one part, Ι account myself most happy,
but if on the other pert,I am one of the most miserable. Balbinus

· pressing him to contract his speech into a narrow compass; I will have

done immediately, says he, and it will be the more easy for me to do
it to a man who understands the whole affair so well, that no man
understands it better. Pl. You are rather drawing an orator than
en alchemist. Lo. You shall hear the alchemist by and by.

This happiness, says he, I have hed from e child, to have learned
that most desirahle art,I mean alchemy, the very marrow of universal
philosophy. At the very mention of the name alchemy, Balbinus
raised himself a little, thet is to say, in gesture only, and fetching a
deep sigh, bid him go forward. Then he proceeds 1—But miserable man
that Ι 0111, said he, by not falling into the right way! Balbinus esking
him what ways those were he spoke of, Good sir, says he, you know
(for whatis there, most learned sir, that you are ignorant oft) that
there are two ways in this art, one which is called the longation, and
the other which is called the curtation. But by my bad fate,I have
