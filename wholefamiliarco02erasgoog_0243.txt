samo time mered with it. aa. Ay, and 88 8 squirrel turns his

wheel-eage about 18 make the belle ring, and is himself carried about ‘

with it. Fu. And 8ο the soul 8118818 the body, and is affected by the
body. Ea. Yes, indeed, as to its operat-iens. Fa. Why, then, as to
the nature 81 11, the 8881 81 8 1881 18 equal 18 the 8881 81 Solomon.
⁸ Ea. There 18 88 absurdity in that. Fa. And so the angela are 88881,
inasmuch 88 they are without matter, which, you say, 18 that which

Ea. We have had philosophy enough. Let divines puzzle them-
selues about these things3 181 88 discourse of those matters that were
first mentioned. If you would be 8 complete mother take care 81 the
body 81 your little infant, 88 that after the little fire 81 the mind has
disengaged 118811 from the vapours‚ it may have sound and fit organa to
make use 81. As often 88 888 hear your child crying think this with
yourself, hc calls for this from me. When you look upon your hreasts,
those two little fountains‚ turgid, and 81 their own accord streaming
out 8 milkyjuice,reme1nber nature puts you in mind 81 8888 duty.
Or 8188, when your infant shall begin to speak, and with his pretty
stammering shall 8811 you mammy‚ how can you hear it without
blushingl when you have refused to let him have it, and turned him
off 18 8 hireling nipple, 88 11 you had committed him to 8 goat or 8
sheep. When he is able 18 speak, what 11, instead 81 calling you
mother, he should call you half-mothcrl I suppose you would whip

what she has brought 1818 the world. The nourishing 81 the tender
babe is the best part 81 geniture 3 for he is not only fed by the milk,
but with the fragrancy of the body 81 the mother. He requires the
same natural, familiar, accustomed moisture, that he drew in when in
her body, and by which he received his coalition. And I am of that
opinion that the genius 81 children are vitiatcd by the nature of the
milk they suck, 88 the juices 81 the earth change the nature of those
plante and fruita that it feeds.

Do you think there 18 88 foundation in reason for this saying, He
sucked in this ill humour with the nursc's milkl Nor do I think the
Greeks spoke without 888888, when they said like 888888, when they
would intimate that any one was rtarved 81 nurse: 188 they put 8 little
*of what they chew into the child’s 1888111, but the greatest part goes
down their own throats. And, indeed, she can hardly properly bc said
to bear a child that throws it away as soon 88 she has brought it forth—

that is to miscarry ; and the Greek etymology 81 Μήτηρ from μη τηρειν,
ie, from not looking 81188, seems very well to suit such mothers. For
