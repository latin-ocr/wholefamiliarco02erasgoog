contrivance of wicked doctore, that they might get the more money.

· Fi. Ido not know what doctore they are that you spealr of; for Ι am

sure none are greater enemies to fish than they are. Bo. Goodman
coxcomb, to set you right in this matter, it is not for your sake nor
the love of fieb, for none are more adverse than they to the eating it,
but it is their own game they play. The more people are troubled
with coughs, consumptione, and chronic distempers, the more they
eth it

g Fi. Ι will not advocate for doctors in this matter, let thern arengo
their own quarrel when they get thee into their clutches. The ancient
sanctimony of life, the authority of the most approved, the majesty of
bishops, and the public usage of Christian nations are enough for my
tktffllffltltttlttllh milleiti ltrltllgtrttt
cate for doctore, and so do I to bean accuser or censurer of the ancients,
or common custom. These itis my custom to revere, but not revile.
Fi. Yon are more cautious than pious in this point, or Ι am mistaken
in you, butcher. Bu. In my opinion, they are the wisest that have
least to do with those that carry thunderbolts in their hands. But,
however, I will not conceal what Ι understand from my Bible, trans·
lated into my mother tongue, that Ι sometimes read. Fi. What now,
the butcher is turned parson too.

Ba. 1 arn of the opinion that mankind, in the first agee, being
newly formed out of primitive clay, were of more healthful eonstitu-
tlons. This appears by their vivacity. More than that, I believe
paradise was a place commodiorrsly situated, and in a very healthy
elimate. Such bodies, in such a situation, might be sustained without
food,by breathing the very air and fragrancy of herbe, trees‚and flowers,
that exhaled everywhere, and especially the earth, spontaneously pro
ducing all things in abundance without man’s sweating or toiling, who
was neither infected with distempers nor old age. The dressing of such
a garden was not a toil, but rathere pleasure. Fi. Hitherto you seem
to be right. aa. Of the various increase of so fertile a gardan nothing
was prohibited but the nse of one single tree. Fi. That is true too.
Ba. And that for this reason only, that they might pay their acknow-
ledgment to their Lord and Creator by obedienee. Fi. All this is
ver riht.

yBag. Moreover, Ι verily believe that the new earth produced
everything better in its kind, and of a more nutritive juice thenit does
now, grown old and almost past bearing. Fi. Well, I grant it. Take
that sor granted. Ba. And that especially in paradise. Fi. lt is
very probable. Bu. If so, then eating was rather for the sake of
pleasure than necessity. Fi. Ihave heard so. Be. At that time to
abstain from eating flesh was rather humanity than sanctity. Fi. 1
do not know. 1 read that the eating of flesh was permitted after the
llood, but I do not. read it was forbidden before. But to what
purpose were it to permititis it were permitted beforel Ba. Why ,
do not we eat frogsl Not because theylare forbidden, but because we
have an aversion to them. How can you tell whether eod might not
instruet man what food human nature required, and not what He
permittedl 'Fa Ioannot divino.

Ba. But, presently after man¹e creation, we read, “ Rule ye over
