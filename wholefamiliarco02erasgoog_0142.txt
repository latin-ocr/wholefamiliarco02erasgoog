THE nuhaa? WIFE. 135

nothing else but his person aud bare outside; she chooses him by
her ears who carefully observes what reputation ιο has in the world.

Xa. This is good advice, but it is too late. aa. But it is not too
late ιο endeavour to amend your husband. It will contributa some·
thing to the matter if you could have any children by him. Xe. Ι
have had oue. hu. Whent Xo. A long time ago. aa. How
many monthsl Xo. Why, about seven. It'u. What do I hearl
You put me in mind of the joke of the three months lying in. Xo.
By no means. Eu. It must be sais you reckon from the day of
marriage. Xa. But I had some private discourse with him before
marriage. aa. Are children got by talkingl Xa. He having by
chance got me into a room by myself‚ began ιο play with me, tickling .
me about the arm-pits and sides, ιο make me laugh‚ and I not being
able to bear being tickled any longer, threw myself flat upon the bed,
aud he lying upon me, kissed me, aud I do not know what he did tc
me besides ; but this is certain, within a few days after, my belly began
to swell. Eu. Get you goiie noW, and slighta husband, who if he
can get children jesting, what will he do if he sets about it in earnestl
X a. Ι suspect that Ι am now with child by him again. Eu. Oh bravo l
to a good soil here is a good ploughman to till it. Xa. As ιο this
affair he is better than Ι wish he was. Eu. Very few wives have
this complaint ιο make. But, I suppose, the marriage coutract was
made between you before this happened. Xe. It was made. Eu.
Then the sin was so much the less. Is your child a boyl Xe. It is.
Eu. That will reconcile you both, if you will but qualify yourself a
little for it. “

What sort of character do your husband’s companions give himt
and what company does he keep when he is abroadl Xa. They give

⁰ , him the character of an exceeding good-humoured, courteous, genereus

man, and a true friend to his friend. Eu. These things give me great
hopes that ιο will become such as we would have him be. Xa. But
Iam the only person he is not soto. Eu. Do you but be to him
what Ι have told you, aud if he does not begin to be so to you, instead
of Eulalia (a good speaker), call me Pseudolalia (a prating liar); and
besides, considentis, that he is but a young man yet, 1 believe not
above twenty-four years of age, and does not yet know what it is ιο ιο
ιιο master of a family. You must never think of a divorce now.
Xo. But I have thought on it a great many times.

Idu. But if ever that thought comes into your mind again, first cf
all consider with yourself what au insignificaut figure a woman makes
when she is parted from her husband. It is the greatest glory of a
matron to be obedient to her husband. This N ature dictatas, and it is
the will of God that the woman should wholly depend upon her
husband. Only think, as it really is, heis your husband-you cannot
have another. Theu eall to mind that the little boy belongs ιο you
both. What would you do with himl Would you take him away
with youl Then will you defraud your husband of his own. Will
you leave him to himl Then you will deprive yourself of that, thau
which nothing is more dear.

Last of all, tell me is there anybody that wishes you illl Χα. Ι
have a stepmother, and a mother-in-law as like her as may be. Eu.
And they wish you ill, do theyl Xa. They wish me in my grave.
