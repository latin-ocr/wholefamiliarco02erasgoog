indeed, I think this house of 0110010 10 within the compass 01 0100010
and convenient, 101 11001 luxury, or I am 1010101100. Some that live
by begging have 10111 with more state ; and yet these gardens 01

,Era Give me the book. In this place Jesus Christ seems to me 10
1000 said the 80100 thing twice; 101 instead of what He had said in
the first placa—ie, “ He will hate ’'—He says immediately, “He will
despise.'’ And 101 what He had said before, “ He will love,’¹ He hy
and by turns it, “ He will hold to.” Τ10 sense is the same, though the
persons 010 changed. Ti. I do not very well apprehend what you
mean. Ea. Let me, 11 you 010000, demonstrate it mathematically.
In the first part, put A 101 the 000 0οἀ Β 101 110 other. In the latter
part, put B 101000 and A 101110 01101, inserting 110 order ; 101
011101 A will hate and B will love, or B will hold 10 and A will
despise. Is it 001 plain now that A is twice heted arrd B twice
helovedl Ti 'Tis very clear. Ea. This conjunctius or, especially
repeated, has the emphasis 010 00011010, 01 01 least a different mean·
ing. Would it not be otherwise absurd to say, “ Either Peter shall
overeome 100, 0οἀ Ι will yicld; or I will yield, and Peter shall 0001-
000101001” Τι’. Apretty sophiam, as Ι aman 100001 man. Eu. 1
shall think it 80 when you have made it out, 001101010.

rte. 11000 something runs in 10010101, and Iam with child to
hare it out: I cannot tell what 10 0101100111,1011011110010111
will, you shall 100011, if you please; if it be 01110001, you shall be 110
interpretare, or midwife it into the world. Eu. Although it is
looked upon to 10 00100110 10 talk 01 (1100010 01 10110, and it is im-
modest to bring 10111 101010 so many men, but 1118 dream, or this

rte. In my judgment, 1110 rather the thing than the 001000 1101
10 changed in this text. And the words one and one do 001 10101 10
