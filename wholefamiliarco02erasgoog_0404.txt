CONCERNING OERTAIN PROBLElIS. 397

in the beginning vigour adds alacrit,y tand near the end the hope of

comingto what the animal arms ιι. Cu. Ioannot tell how 1t rs with
other animals3 but 1 have got a maid· servant who' ιι weary before she

beg'v,1ns and tired before she ends. But return to what you beg trun.

Al. I say, heavy things are ca1ried downward bya natural motion3
and by how much the heavier anything ιι, ιγ ιο much a swifter
motion it is carried towards the earth, and ιγ how much the lighter it
is, ιγ ιο much the swifter motion it ιι carried toward heaven. It
is quite otherwise in a violent motion, which, being swist at first,
grows slower by degrees 3 and contrary in a natural motion, as an arrow
shot into the air, and a stone falling from on high. Ura Iused to
think that men ran about upon the globe οι ιιι earth like little anteon
a great ball3 they stick upon it everywhere, and none fall off. ll.
That is ιο ιο attributed ιο ιιι ruggedness οι ιιι globo, and a certain
roughness in the feet οι ιιι ants, which, indeed, is common to all
insecta m a manner, aud lastly,t to the lightness οι their bodies lf
you do not believe me, make a glass globo very smooth and sleek3 y‘ou
will see that only those ants do not fall that are at the upper part of
it. Cu. If any god should bore through the centre of the earth ,quite
down to the antipodess 111 a perpendicular line, and as cosmographers
use to represent the situation of the globe οι ιιι οιιιι, and a stone
wore let fall into it, whither would it gol ιιι. To the centre οι ιιι
earth3 there all heavy bodies rest. Oa. What ιι ιιι antipodes
should let fall a stone on their idel Al. Then one stone would meet
the other about the centre, and stop theie.

Cu. But hark you, ιι what you said just now ιο true, that a
natural motion by ιιι progress grew more and more strong, if nothing
hindered a stone or lead cast into the hole, by reason οι ιιι vehemence
of ιιι motion it would pass beyond the centro, and having got beyond the
centre, the motion would grew more violent. Al. Lead would never
come ιο ιιι centre unless it were melted 3 but a stone, if it did pass
the centre with so violent a motion, would go at first more heavily and
return to the centre again, just ιι a stone thrown up into the air
returns again to the earth. Cu. But returning back again by its
natural motion, and again recovering force, it would go beyond the
centre, and ιο ιιι stone would never rest. Al. It would lio stillat
last by running beyond, and theh 'running back again till it carne to an
equilibrium. Oa. But ιι there beno vacuum in nature, then that

ἃ hole must ιι full οι ιιι. Αἰ. Supposeittobeso. Cu. Thenabody

that ιι ιγ nature heavy will hang in the air, Al. Why not l as steel
does, being borne up by the loadstone. Wh'at wonder is it that one
stone hang in the very middle οι ιιι ιιι, when the whole earth laden
with so many rocks hange after ιιι same mannerl

Cu. But where is the centre of the earthl Al. Where is the
centre οι ι circlel Oa. That is a point that is indivisible3 if tho
centre σι ιιι earth be so small, wh'osoever bores through the centre
takes it away, and then heavy bodies have nowhere to tend ιο Al.
Now you talk idly enough Cu. Pray, do not be angry whatIsay
ιι for the sake of information Ιι any one should bore through ιιι
globo οι ιιι earth, and not through the centre itself, ιι suppose one
hundred lullong ι aeide οι ιι, where would a stone fall thenl At It

would not pass straight through the holo. Ιι would, indeed, go
