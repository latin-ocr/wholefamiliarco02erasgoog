362 FArllILIAR COLLOQUIES.

a oardinal's hat, if it he offered them. Hi. Α cardinal’s hat, say youl
no, nor a triple orown neither. And those humble sons ol poor St.
Francis will put forth their slippers to be hissed by the greatest
monarcha in the world. Le. And then if you should use the term
vilitas to them, it would be an anpardonable orime. Hi. Unpardon-
able, indeed, if by vile you mean that which is of small account among
men, or seems contemptible to itself. But what need is there to make
an excuse for that which was not saidl

Le. But was not Merdardus ashamed to tell that lie, and at ohuroh
too, and in one of the most famous ones, and in the hearing of a great
assembly of monarche, a great many learned men that had read orer
Erasmus’s writingrl Hi. Ashamed, say youl no, the buffoon thought
he deserved the laurel for it; for this is the fourth vow ol the Merdar-
dians, that they observa more religiously than the other three, not to
be ashamed of anything. Le. There are, indeed, a great many that
are very studious ol that. Hi. But this was not a single lie neither ;
sor, in the first place, the song ol' Mary as Luhe wrote it remains
untouohed. How oan he he said to correct anything that makes no
alteration in itl And then the word humilitas is not altered, nor is
there any mention made ol uilitas. And, in the last plaos, he does not
correct the song who translates faithfully what Lulre wrote, hut'only
explains it. Le. l perceive a threesold lie, very like such a buffoon.

Hi. But hold, you have not heard the greatest piace os impudenoe
yet. Ee. What, have you any more thenl Hi. He exelaimed
against that ass as the head, author, and ringleader of all the tumults
that are in the Christian world. Le. Say you sot Hi. And that
it is to be charged upon him that the churoh is torn in pieoes hy so
many sectaries, that the olergy are despoiled of their tithes, that the
bishops aro set light hy, and the sacred authority of the pope himself
is everywhere disregarded3 that ploughmen play the part of the old
gigantis race. Le Does he say these things publiolyl Hi. Pus
lielyl ay, and makes a mighty olamouring too. Le. But they are
quite os another mind that have attentively read over the writings
ol' Erasmus. A great many of them will acknowledge that they have
from his performances collected tho seeds of true piety. And this fire
that has been kindled by the monks is got to that height that all
the endeavours they use to put it out are hut just as if you should pour
oil into a fire. Ili. Yon see what an evil beast the helly is. La
Yon have hit the nail on the head. Itis, indeed, for theintereat of
suoh follows that there be a great deal of superstition in the Christian
world, and buta very little tr-ue religion. But what said the auditoryl
could thoy bear to hear suoh an ass bruy in the pulpiti

Hi. Some wondered what was come to the man. Those that were
of a choleris temper went out of the ohuroh nrurmuring, saying, We
came to hear the praises of the holy Virgin set forth, and, this drunlren
fellow is vorniting out his mere calumnias upon us. And there were a

great many women present. Le. This sex usedto be mightyadmirers -

of this order of men. Hi. You say right; but the women perceived
what sort of a fellow he was. And some that were women os reading
were nneasy, and some hissed him. Le. But an ass does not mind
