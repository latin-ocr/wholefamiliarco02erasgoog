and held 6 long disputa, had sll their meat thrown on the 11661 by
Xantippe, who in araga cverturned the table. 11. I believe you
have nothing 61 that to be afraid 61. 8116 is 66661 the beat-bumoured
women in the world. Eu. She is such a 666, indeed, that I should be
loathe 16 change 1161 11 Ι might 3 and Ι look upon mysslf to be very
happy upon that account. N 61 do Ι like their opinion who thinks
man happy because he never had a 11116 ; Iapprove rather what the

’ 11611661 saga said, “ He that has a good wife has 6 good lot.'' It 16

616 bad, or making them 66, 61 6166 161661 teaching them better.

Eu. You say very right ; but all this while I want to hear 1116
third 16166 expounded, and methinks 1116 divine Theophilus looks as
11 he had a mind 16 do 11. Theo. Truly my mind was upon my belly;

' but, however, Ι will speak my mind, since Ι 1661 do it without 6116666,

Eu. N ay, it will be 6 favour 16 66 if you should happen 16 be in any error,
because by that means you will give us occasion 61 finding 1116 trutb.
Tb. The sentence seems 16 be 61 1116 same importance with that the
Lord expresses by the prophet Hosea (chap. vi), “ Ι desire mercy and

This is 111111 explained, and to 11161116, by the Lord J esus in St. Matthew
(61161). 11.), who being 61 table in the house 61 Levi the publican,
with several others 61 1116 same stamp and profession, the Pharisees,
who were puffed up with their external observante 61 the law without
any regard to 1116 precepta 61 11, whereupon the whole law and propheta
depend‚ (with 6 design to alienate the 6116611666 61 Η16 disciples 11661
Η116) asked them why their Master sat at the table 61 publicans and
sinnersl 11661 whose conversation those Jews that would be accounted

had 1661 661 61 them 1116116666, as soon as they came home they would
wash themselves. And when the disciples‚ being yet but raw, could

, give no answer‚ the Lord 6661161611116111161Η11666116611 them: “ They‚”

says He, “who 616 whole need -not a physician, but they that are sick ;
but go you and 16616 what that meaneth, Ι will have mercy and not
sacrifice—3 161 Ι 66616 661 16 call the righteous but sinuers.'’ Eu.
