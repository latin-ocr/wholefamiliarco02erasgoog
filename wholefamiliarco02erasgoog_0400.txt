why he is thus serviceable 10 him. For that the crocodile opens 1110
jaws 101 the little wren is not to be attributed to friendship, when
either creature is led by its own advantage. The crocodile loves to
have his teeth cleansed, and therefore embraces the pleasure 01 having
them picked ; and 1110 wreu seeks her foed, feeding upon the fragments
01 fish that stick in the other's teeth, and for the same reason a crow
rides upon a sow's back. There is such a stubborn enmity between
the anthus and aegythus, that it 10 affirmed their blood will not
mingle one with the ether, just as it is related of other birds, that
their feathers will consume away 11 they be mingled with those 01
the ea le.

Aghawk is a deadly enemy to 1110 dovekind, but the little bird the
kestrel defends them, 101 a hawk is wonderfully afraid either to see or
hear that bird. Nor are the pignone ignorant 01 this;whe1·esoever
the kestrel has her nest, they will never leave that place, relying upon
their defendere. Who ean give a reason why a kestrel should be se
friendly to pigeons, or why a hawk should be so afraid 01 0 kestrell
And as a very little animal is sometimes 0 saleguard to a great beast,
00, 011 the contrary, 0 very little one is 011011 0 destruction to a great
one. There is a little fish in the 101111 01 0 scorpion, and 01 1110 size 01
the fish quequiner; he sometimes sticks his sting into the fin of
1111111100,11101011011 010 bigger than 0 delphin, and puts thern to that
torture that they sometimes leap into ships, and the same hc does 10
the mullet. What should be the reason that 0 11011, thetis terrible to
all animals, should be struck with 100101 hearing a cock crowl

Jo. Τ1101 1 may not bo altogether scot-free in this entertainment,
Iwill tell you what i saw with my own eyes in the house 01 that
1011101ιο Englishman Sir Thomas More: He kept in his 1101100 0 large
monkey, who, that 110 might the sooner get well 01 a wound he had
received, was suffered to go loose. At the end 01 1110 garden there
were rabbits kept 111 1111101100, and a weasel used to watch them very
narrowly. The monkey sitting 01001 off quietly, as though 11110011-
cerued, observed all his 1110110110 1111 he saw the rabbits were in no
danger 110111 him. But perceiving the weasel had loosened a board in
the back part 01 the hutoh, and that now they svers in danger to he
attached in the rear, and so be made 0 prey to their enemy, the ape
runs, jumps up on the plank and put it 11110 its former place with as
much dexterity 00 any man could have done; 110111 whence it is plain
that apes 010 great lovers 01 this animal. So the coneys, not knowing
their own danger, that used to kiss their enemy through the grate,
were preserved by the monkey. Apes 010 mightily delighted with all
young whelps, and love to hug them and carry them about in their
arms. Ep. But that good-natured monkey did really deserve 10 be
made amends 1011110 kindness. Jo. And he was too, Ep. Howl
Jo. He found there a piece 01 breed that had, Ι suppose, been thrown
there by the children, which he took up and ate.

Ep. But it seems most admirable to me that this kind 01 sympathy
and antipathy, as the Greeks call 0 natural affection 01 friendship and
eumity, should be found even in things that have neither life nor
sense. Iomit to mention the ash tree, the very sbadow 01 which a
serpent cannot endurej so that how sar soever it spreads, 11 you make
a circle os tire 01 the same signas, 1110 serpent will sooner go into
