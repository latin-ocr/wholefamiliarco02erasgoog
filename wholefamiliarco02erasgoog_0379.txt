37 2 FAMILIAR destoueles.

that there was no being quiet in the day-time, nor sleeping 111 the
night Ja. What a wretched wealth was hercl Gi. Few were
wealthier in this sort 01 cattle. J a. Sure your women were 111] aluta.
oi. They were mewed up in an apartment by themselves, and selden
came among the men 3 so that you have nothing 01 them but the name
01 women; and the men are forced 10 go without those services which
properly belong to that sex in other familias. Ja. But how could
Autronius away with all this nastinessl Gi. Pshaw, he was used to
it from his cradle, and minded nothing in the world but getting of
money. He loved to be anywhere but at home, and traded in every·
thing you can think of. Yon know that city is a great town of the
greatest commerce and business. What is his name, the famous painter,
who thought that day was lost wherein he did 1101 employ his penei13
and our Autronius loolred upon himself undone if one single day

sed over his head without some profit And if such a disaster
hi'ppened 10 him, he did not fail one way or otberto make it up
ethome.

Ja. What did he dol cl. Why, he had scistern of water inthe
house, as most people in that city have, whence he used to draw so
many buckets of water, and ‘put into his hogsheads of wine. This was
amost certain profit. Ja. Ι suppose the wine was something of the
strougest thenl oi. Far from that, for it was asdeadas ditch water ς for
he never bought any but what was deeayed to his hand, that he might buy
it at sn easier rate. And that he might not lose a drop of this, he used
10 mix and jumble the grounds 01 at least ten years standing, and set
them a fermenting, that it might pass for new wine upon the less, and
would not lose a drop of the dregs neither. Ja. If we may believe
the physicians, such wine will certainly breed the stone. Gi. There
were no doctors there, I will assure you 3 and in the most healthful
years two 01 three at least 01 111 family died of thet distemper3 but
he never troubled his head about that, how many burials went out of
the house. Ja. No! Gi. He made a penny even of the dead.
And there was no gain he was ashamed to take, though 11 was never
10 small. Ja. Under your favour, that was downright theft though.
Gi. Your merchants term it turning an honest penny.

Ja. But what sort of liquor did Autronius drink all the whilel
Gi. Almost the very same nectar that 1 told you of. Ja. Did he find
no harm by 111 Gi. He was as hard as a flint, he could have lived

10 11 acertain profit to him. Ja. How so,I beseech youl ci. If you
rechon his wife, his sons, his daughters, his son-in-law, his men-servants,
and his maid-servants, he had about thirty-three mouths in the family
to feed. Now the more he corrected his wine with water the less of it
was drunk, and the longer it was drawing off ; so then if you compute
a large bucket 01 water thrown in every day it will amount to no small
sum, let me tell you, at the year¹s end. Ja. A sordid sellow! oi.
This was not all, he made the same advantage of his bread too. Ja.
How could he do 11111 Gi. He bought musty wheat, such as uobody
else would buy but himself Now, in the first placabere was a pre·
sent gain, because he bought it 10 much cheaper, and then 11 had an

art 10 cure the mustiness. Ja. But, prithee, how did hedo chaat
