THE 111οΗ MISER. 373

Gi. There is a sort 01 chalk, not altogether unlike to corn, which you
may see horsea 010 delighted with when they gnaw it out 01 the walls,
and drink more freely out 01 that pond-water where this chalk 10 10 be
found. He mixed one-third part at 10001 01 this earth with 1110 broad.
Ja. And do you eall this curing 01 itt

Gi. This 10 certain, that it made the mustiness of the corn be not
altogether 00 perceivable; and now, was not this a considerable profitl
He had another stratagem besides that, 101 he baked his own broad at
horne, which, in the very midst 01 summer, he never did oftener than
twice in a mouth. Jo. Sura it must be more like stenes than bread
101 hardness et. Nay, harder than a stone, if possible; but we had
a remedy 101 that too. Ja. What was thatl ei. We used 10 00011
011000 01 this bread in bowls 01 wine. Jo. The devil a barrel the
better herring. But how did the servants like this treatmentl Gi. ·
I will first tell you how the top lolks 01 the family were sarred, and
then you may easily guess how the servants sared. Ju. Ilong 10 hear
it. (Ji. There was not a word 10 be mentioned about breakfast, and
00 101 dinner that was generally delerred till one o'clock in the 01101-
noon. Ja. Why sol Gi. We waited 101 the 1110010101 the family's
coming home, and then we seldom went to supper before ten

Ja. But how did you bear itt you used to be very impatient 101
, your 11010010 Gi. I called ever and anon upon Orthrogonus, our
landlord's son-in-law, who lay upon the same floor with mysell : Soho,

' monsieur, said I, do you make no dining today at Synodiuml He

answered, Autronius will be here in a minute. Then finding not the
least motion towards dinner, and my guts very mutinous, Hark you,
Orthrogonus, said I, do you design 10 010110 us to-dayl Then he
would persuade me it was not 00 1010, 01 put me off with some such
pretence. Then, not being able to bear the bawling my bowels made,
Ι interrupted him again: What, do you mean, said I, to 010110 us to
deathl When he found he had nemore excusas to make, he went
down 10 the servants and ordered them to lay the cloth. But at last,
when no Autronius came, and diuner seemed to be 00 101 off as ever,
Orthrogonus, wearied with the 1101001 made in his ears, went 101110
apartment where 111011110οι11 mother, and children were, bidding
them gat dinner ready.

Ju. Well‚ now I expect to hear 01 the dinner. Gt. Pray do not

be 00 hasty. Then 111010 came a lame fellow, just such another 00 ·

Vulca-n, who laid the eloth, 101 that it seems was his province 3 this
was the first hope we had 01 dinner, and 01 1001, after I had bawled 0
long time, a glass bottle 01 1011 water is brought in. Ju. Well‚ now
there 10 more hope. Gi. But I tell you, do 1101 be too hasty. Again‚
· not without a great deal 01 knocking and calling, in comesa bottle 01
the wine I spoke of, as thick with drage 00 puddle-water. J a. That is
well, howover. Gi. But notabit 01 bread came along with it, though
there was no great danger we should touch it, 101 000100 anybody would
had they been ever so hungry. Then I fell 10 calling till I was hoarse

with this unlucky pretence, that his belly achad. Ja. But what was
