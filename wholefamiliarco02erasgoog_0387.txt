380 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

a child, who, according to the world, was neither wisa nor learned, bnt
very acceptable to God and man for the strict mortification of his worldly
affectione 3 and not only for him, but for all who following his footsteps
endeavour from their hearts to be dead to the world and to lire to
Christ. But as to the habit itaelf,I value it not, and I would fain

- know of γοα what a dead man is the better for a gement l ra Yon

know it is the Lord's precept, ‘⁶ not to mat pearla before swina, nor to
give holy things to dogs.’' Besides, if you ask questions to make your-
self merry with them, I will tell you nothing at all ; but if you do it
with an honest desire of being informed, I will very freely eommuni-
eate to yon what I have learned from them Pa I profess myselt'
willing to learn, and promise to be an attentive, teaehable, and the-nk-
ful scholar.

Ta. In the first place, you know that there are some persons that
are so ambitione, that it is not enough for them to have lived proudly
aad insolently, but they must be buried pompously too when they are
dead 3 not that the dead are senaible‚ but yet while they assalire they
take some pleasure, by the force of imagination, to think ofthe pomp of
their funerals. Now Ι suppose you will not deny bnt- it is sorne degree
of piety to renounee this vain affectation. Pa I will own it, if thera
be no other way to avoid the ranity of pompona funerala But in my
opinion it is more modest for a prinae when he is dead to be wrapped
in a coarae winding-sheet, and ta be carried by the common hearers, and
· interred in the common buryingplaoe among the common sort οἰ
people3 for they that were carried as Eusebius was carried do rather
seem to have changed their pride than avoided it. Ta. Itis theinten·
tion of the mind that God accepts, and it is His province only to jndge
os men's hearts But what Ι have told you is but a small matter, there'
are greater things behind. Ph. What are theyl Ta. They profess
themselves of the order of St. Francis’s rnle beforetheir- death. Ph.
What, that they will observe it in the Elysian fieids l ra. No, but in
this world if they happen to recover, and it oftentimes has happened
that they that have been given over by the physicians have by God's
blessing recovered as soon as ever they have put on this holy roho.
Pa. Ay, and it often happens so to those that never put iton at all.

Ta. We ought to walls with simplieity in the way of saith. If
there were no extraordinary advantage m this case, certainly so many
learned and eminent persons, even among the Italians themselves, would
not be so desirous of being buried in this holy habit, But lest yon
should object against the examples of strangers, 1 will tell you that one
whom you very deservedly had an high esteem for was thus buried-
Rudolphns Agricola, and so was ChristopherIongolius too Pa. Ido
not regard what men do being delirious at the point of death. I worrld
fain have you tell me what good professing, or being clothed‚ does a man
when he comesto be terrified with the fears of death, and diseomposed
with despair of life. Vows are of no force unless they be made in
sound sense and sobriety, with mature deliberation, without either
force, sear, or guilt. Nay, if nothing of all thia were required, such a
vow is not binding till after the expiration of the year of probation, at
which time they are columanded to wear the ooat and hood. This is
what St. Francis himself says; so that if they recessu, they are at

liberty 'm two respecta, bemuse a vow ia not binding that is made by a
