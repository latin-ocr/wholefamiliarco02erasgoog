off that had performed so small a service), not considering that there
is a great difference betweendoing a thing sincerely and doing it

crattily, approached the king with the like gesture 5 and he offering
himself to him, he made ashow of taking something of his germont,
which he presently threw away. But when the king was urgent upon
him, seeming unwilling to tell what it was, mimieking abundance of
modesty, he et last told him it was aflea. The king perceiving the
fraud, says to him, What, do you make a dog of mel and orders him
to be taken away, and instead of forty crowns orders him forty stripes.

Pa. Ι bear it is no good jesting with kings5 for as lions will
sometimes stand still to be stroked, are lions again when they please,
and kill their playfellow, just so princes play with men. But Ι will
tell you a story not much unlike yours, not to go off from Itonia who
used to take a pleasure in trieking tricksters. He had received a

· present of ten thousand crowns from some place, and as often aethe

courtiers know the king has gotten any fresh money, all the officers are
presently upon the hunt to. catch sonae part of it. This Leuis knew
very well: this money being poured out upon a table, he, to raise all
their expectations, thus bespeaks them, What say you, am not Ι Θ very
rich kingl Where shall Ι bestow all this moneyl It was presented
to me, and I think it is meet Ι should make presente of it again.
Whero are all my friends to whom Ι am indebted for their good ser
vicesl Now let them come before this money is gone. At that word
a great many came running ; everybody hoped to get some of it.

The king taking notice of one that looked very wishfully upon it,
and as if he would devour it with hia eyes, turning to him, says, well,
friend, what have you to seyl ΗΘ informed the king that he hed for
a long time very faithfully kept the king's hawks, and becn ata great
expense thereby. One told him one thing, another another, every one
setting cothis service to the best advantage, end ever and anon lying
into the bargain. The king heard them all very patiently, and
approved of what they said. This consultation held a long time, that

he might tease them the more, by keeping them betwixt hope and .

despair. Among the rest stood the great chancellor, for the king had
ordered him to be sent for too ; he, being wiser than the rest, says never
a word of his own good services, but was only a spectator of the comedy.

At length the king turning toward him, says, Well, what says my
chancellor to the matterl ΗΘ is the only man that asks nothing, and
says nevere word of his good services. I, says the chancellor, have
received more already from your royal bounty than I have deserved.
Ι am so far from craving more, that Ι arn not desirous of anything so
much-as to behave myself worthy of the royal bounty I have received.
Thea, says the king, you arethe only man of them all that does not
want money. Saye the chancellor, Ι must thank your bounty that 1
do not. Then he turns to the others and says, Ι am the most magni-
ficent prince in the world, that have such a wealthy chancellor. This
more inflamed all their expectatione that the money would be distri·

’ buted among thern, since he desired none of it. When the king had

played upon them after this manner a pretty while, he made the
' chancellor take it all up and carry it home; then turning to the rest,
who now looked a little dull upon it, says he, You must stay till the
next opportunity.
