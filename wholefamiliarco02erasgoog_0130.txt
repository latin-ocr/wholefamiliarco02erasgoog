or virgin remarkable for piety in whose company you may get good, if
you aee any man that ιο endowed with singular probity from whom
you may learn what will make ιοι your bettering, you may have their

most purely. When once you come into a cloister all these things,
that are the greatest assistances' ιιι the promotion οι true piety, you
lose at once.
