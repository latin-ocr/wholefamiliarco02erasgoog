- IOHTHYOPHAGIA; 011, FISH-EATINO. 263

tiles, what scripture is there that says plainly of the Jews, that if they
1ἂά 0111111100 lh& gospel they should he freed 110111 the servitude of the
osaical law

ri. That was prophesied by tlre prophete, who promise a new
covenant and a new beart, and introduce (1011 05 abhorring the festival
days of the Jews, aversating their meatofferings,abh01ring their fasta,
rejecting their gifos, and desiring a people of circumcised hearts 3 and
tha Lord himself confirmed what they had promised, who holding forth
to His disciples His body and blood, calls it the N ew Testament. If
nothing be aholished of the old, whyis this called a new onel The
Lord did not only abrogato tho J ewish choico of meats by His example,
but by His doctrine, when He denies that man is defiled by meats
which go into the stomacb, and pass thence into the draught. He
toaches Peter the same by a vision, and Peter himself shews the same,
in that ho, with Paul and others, ate of common meats from which the
law commanded them to abstain. Paul treats in this manner every-
where in his epistles, noris there any doubt but what Christiana now
practise was handed down tous by tradition from the apostles 1110111-
501101. So that the Jews were not so properly set at liberty as weaned
from superstition as 110111 the milk to which they had been accustomed
and made familiar, but now was grown out of season.

Neither is the law abrogated, but it is but requisite that that part
of it should give way which was not essential Leaves and flowers
bespeak fruit coming; and when atrae is loaded with that nobody
covets the leaves. Nor is anybody sorry that his son’s puerility is
gone when maturity of age is come. Nor does anybody call for candles
and torches when the sun is got above the horizon. N or does a
schoolmaster complain if a son, being come to man's estate, puts in his
claim for freedom‚ and in histum has the master under bis tuition
A pledge cesses to be a pledge when tha thing promised is produced.
The sponse comforts herself with the bridegroom's letters till 5110 is
married—she kisscs his presents, embraces his picture; but when she
comes to enjoy his company she dirregards those things she before
admired 1011110 sake of it. Tho 1011 at first were very hardly brought
off from those things they had been aecustomed to, which is just as if
a child that had been used to suck, being grown a lusty follow, should
cry for the hreast and slight more solid food. So they wore forced, as
it were, from those figures, shadows, and temporary 0011110110, that they
might entirely turn themselves to Him whom that law had promised
and shadowed out.

Bu. Who would have expected so much divinity from a seller 01

-fisb, und by that meana they often dine with me, and Ι sometimes with
them, and I gothered these things 110111 their diacouraea. Bu. In
1111111, instead of a seller 01 salt fish, you deserve to be 0001101 01 fresh
fish But, prithee, tell me if you were a J ew (for I cannot very well
tell whether you are one 01 not), and you were like to be atarved with
hunger, would you eat swine’s flesh or rather diel Fa I cannot very
well tell what 1 should do, forII do not yet well understand Iwhat I

ought to do. Ba. ch has forbid both, “Thou shalt not kill,'’ and ι

“Τ11011 shalt not eat swine's dash.’' In such a caseos this, which
precept must give way to the 0111011
