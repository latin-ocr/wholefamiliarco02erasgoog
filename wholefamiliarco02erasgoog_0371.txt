foolish society that maintains such cattle ae this ist Hi. Yon ean

upon themselves, fot· 1)] such doings as these especially, they make
themselves odious to all good men, and brin themselves into contempt
more effectuallythan an enemy can do. hut it is not a Christian
spirit to wish ill to any one; but we ought rather to wish that the
most merciful Creator and Reformer of all things—who made N ebuchad-
