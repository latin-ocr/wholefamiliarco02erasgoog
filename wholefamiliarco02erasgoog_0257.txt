like wood 3 the cissites and'naicissites represent ivy, the astrapias darts
forth rays of lightning out of the midst of white or blue, the phlegontites
shews a flama within that does not come out; in the anthracitis you
may see certain spa'rks 'running to and fro5 the crocias represents the
eolour of saffron, the rhodites that of a rose, the chalcites of brass, the
aictites the figure of an eagle with a white tail, the taos represents a
pescock, the chelidonia an asp, the mermecites hes the image of a
cresping piemire growing within it ; the cantharias shews a perfect
beetle 'tnd the scorpites admirably deciphers a scorpion. But why
should I proceed to recount that which is innumerable, when there
is no part of nature, either in elementa, animala, or plants, which
nature, as it were to sport herself, does not give us some resemblance
ofin stoncsl And do you then admire that the form of a toad is
represented in the bufonitesl Me. 1 wonder that nature has so much
spare time as to divert herself in drawing the pictures of everything.
Oy. It has a mind to exercise the curiosity of mankind, and hy that
means to keep us from being idle. And yet, as though we were ata
loss to know howto pass away our time, we run a madding after
buffoons, dice, andjugglers. Me. You say true.

09. And some persons of credit add, that if you put this toad·
stone into vinegar it will move its legs and swim. Me. But why is
this dedicatedto'the 'Virgini Oq. Because she has overoome, trampled
upon, and extinguished all uncleanness, malice, pride, avarica, and all
manner of earthly desires. Mo. Woe to us, then, who carry so much
of the toad still in our heurts! 09. But we shall be pure if we wor-
ship the Virgin as we ought. Me. How would she have us worship
herl 09. You will perform most acceptable service to her if you
imitate her. Me. That is soon said, but not so easily performed.
Oy. Itis hard indeed, but then it is very well worth the pains. Me.
Come on, go forwards in what ,you have begun. Op. Afterwards be
shewed me statues of gold and silver. This, says he, is solid gold, and
this is only silvcr gilt. H e told me the weight of every one, the price,
and the name of the donor.

Ibelng full of admiration at everything, and congratulating the
Virgin being mistress of so much wealth, says the officer to me, Inas
much asl perceive you are ‘so picus a spectator, Ithink I should not
do fairly hy you if I should conceal anything from you, therefore you
shall see the greatest privacies the Virgin has. And presently he takes
out of a drawer from under the altar a world of admirable things, the
particulare of which, if Ι should proceed to mention, the day would not
be long enough, so that thus far the journey succeeded to my wish. I
satisfied my curiosity abundantly with fine sights, and brought home
with mlp thipfinestimable present, -a pledge of the Virgin's love, given
meb erse .

ise. Did you ever make trial of the virtues of this piece of woodl
09. Ihave. Three or four days ago I, being in an house of entertain-
