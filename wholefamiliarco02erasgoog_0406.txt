CONOERNING CERTAIN PROBLEMS. 399 ,

water, because the intenseness oi the. hest dispels the resisting water 3
so an iron wedge sinks. sooner to the bottom than a thin plato. Oa.
Which is the most unbearable, hot iron or coldl Ar. Hot. Oa.
Thea it is heavier. At It is, if it be better to carry burning straw
in your hand than a cold flint. Cu What is the cause that one wood
is heavier or lighter than anotherl Al. The solidity or hollowness.
Cu. But I know one of the King of England's household who, when we
were at table, shewed us some wood which, he said, was the wood of an
aloes trec, so, solid thst it seemcd to be a stone, and so light, if you poised
it in your hand, that it seemed a reed3 being put into wine (for he was
of opinion thet so it would expel poison), it presently sunk to the
bottom as swiftly as lead would. '

Al. Neithcr solidity nor hollowness is always the cause, but a
peculiar occult agreement between things, which is the cause that some
things embraoe or shun other things of a cognate or different quality,
as a loedstone attracto steel, and e vine avoids a colewort; and fleme
will resch toward naphtha set in a lower place, although it be at some
distance, and yet naphtha isnaturnlly heavy and fleme light. Cu. All
sorte of money swim in quicksilrer, and gold only sinks and is inolosed
in it, yet quicksilver is very liquid. Al. Ican give no solution to
that, buta peculias cognate uslity ; and quioksilver was made for the
refinemeut of gold. oa. W ydoes the River Arethusa run under the
Sicanian See, and not rethor swim upon it, when you say that sea-
water isheavier than river-weterl Al. A natural disagresment is the
cause, but it is a secret one. Cra Why do swans swim, when men

water shuns And hence it comcs to pass thetis you put water or wine
into s cloth or linen that is¹ very dry, it contracte itself into a globulsr
form3 but put it into a wet one, it spresds itself presently. And, in
like manner, if you pour any liquid thing into a dry cup, or whose
brims are greased with iat, and pour alittle more than the cup will
hold, the liquor presently gothero itsclf into a round before it will run
over the brim.

Oa. Why cannot ships carry so much in rivers as in thessal
'Al Because river-water is' of a thinncr consistence; and for the same
reason birds poise themselves with more ease in a thick air than in a
thiu one. Cu. Why does nottho fish called flota sinkl ΑΙ. Because
its skin being dried in the sun is made lighter, and resists moisture.
Cu. Why does iron drawn ont into a large plato swim, but being con-
tructed in a narrow compass sinkl Al. Itis dryness is the cause in
part, and partly because there gets in an air between the plats and the
water. Cu. Which is the heaviest, wine or wateri Al. 1 believe
wine will not give place to water. Cu. How comes it about, then, that
they that buy wine of the vintners sometimes find water in the bottom
of the ceskl Al. Because there is in wine a certain fat substance like
oil that resists the uatem the resson is plain, by how much richer the
wine is, so much themora difficultly does it mingle with water ; and
being seton firc, it hurns the fieroer. Oa. What isthe reason that no
living creature will sink in the Lake Asphaltusl Al. Ι cannot give a
solution to all the miracles in natur-⁸3 nature has some arcana that sho
will have us admire but not understand.
