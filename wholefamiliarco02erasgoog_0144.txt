pmy, tell me, was there so great a scarcity 01 good physicians in this
quanter 01 the worldf Cart. Why do you 00111 solt. Because you
did 1101 301 the distemper of your brain cured before you plunged

yourself into this slarery. Cart. Why, do you think 1 was mad thenl
sold. Yes, I do. What occasion 1100111010 for you to bo buried 11010
before your time, when you had enough in the world to have lived

world nowl sou. No, by Jove. Cart. Tell me why. Soti. Be-
cause you 000001 30 where you 1101. You are confiued in this place 00
in a coop. Besides, your bald pate and your prodigious strange dress,
your lonesomeness, your eating 11011 perpetually, so that l wonder you
010 001 turned into a fisb. Cart 111000 were turned into what they
eat, you had long ago been turned into 0 hog, for you used to bea
mighty 10101 01 pork.

Soti. 1110 001 doubt but you bave repented 01 what you hare done
long enough before now, for Ι find but very few that do not repent of it.
0011 This usually happens to those who plunge themselves 1100111003

11010 entered into it warily and considerately, having first made trial
01 myself, and having dnly examined the whole ratio of thia way of
living, being twentyeight years of age, 01 which time every 000 may
be supposed to know himself. And 00101110 place, you 010 0001111011
10 0 small compass as well as Ι, 11 you compare it 10 the extent of 1110

10113 as it wants nothing of the convenientes 01 1110. There are many
that 00111001 0111 001 01 the city in which they were born, which if they
were prohibited from going out would be very uneasy, and would be
wonderfully desirous to do it. This is 0 common humour 111011 010 001
troublod with. 1 fancy this 01000 10 be the whole world to me, and
this map represents the whole globe of the earth, which I can travel
over in thought with more delight and security than he 111010οί1010

Cart. You cannot blame 1110 101 01101103 my head, who voluntarily
have your own' hair clipped 101 convenience' sake. Sbaving to 1110,
11 11 does nothing else, it certainly keeps my head more 01000, 0011
