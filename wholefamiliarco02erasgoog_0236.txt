but his motherl Fa. Why noti it is the fashion. lta. Yon quote
the worst author in the world, Fabulla, the sashion3 it isthe fashion
to do amisa—to game, to whore, to cheat, to be drnnk, and to play the
raka Fa. My friends would have it so ; they were oi opinion Ι ought
to favour myseli, being young. Ea. But if nature gives strength to con·
ceive, it doubtless gives strength to give such too. Fa. That may be.

Eu. Prithee, tell me, do not you think mother is a very pretty
narnel Fa. Yes, Ι do. Ea. And ii such a thing were possible,
would you endure it that another woman should be called the mother
of your childl Fa. By no means. Eu. Why, then, do you volun·
tarily make another woman more than hali the mother of what you
have brought iuto the worldl Fa. Oh fiel Eutrapelus, Ι do not
divide my son in two 3 Ι am entirely his mother, and nobody in the
world else. Eu. Nay, Fabulla, in this case nature herself blames you
to your sace. Why is the earth called the mother of all thingsl Is it
because she produces onlyl N ay, much rather because she nourishes
those things she produces, that which is produced by water is sed by
water. There is not a living creature or a plant that grows on the face
of the earth that the earth does not seed with its own moisture, noris
there any living creature that does not seed its own offspring. Owls,
lions, aud vipers seed their own young, and does womankiud make her
offspring offeastsl Pray, what can be more cruel than they are that
turn their offspring out of doors for laziuess not to supply them with
foodl Fa. That you talk of is abominable. Ea. But womankiud
do not abominate it. Is it not a sort of turning out of doors to com·
mit a tendor little infant, yet reeking of the mother, breathing the very
air oi the mother, imploring the mother’s aid and help with its voice,
which they say will effect even abruta creature, toa woman perhaps
that is neither wholesome in body nor honest, who has more regard to
a little wages than to your childl Fa. But they have made choica
of a wholesome, sound woman.

aa. Of this the doctors are better judges than yourseli But put Δ

the case: she is as healthful as yourself, and more too, do you think
there is no difference between your little tendor infant's sucking its
natural and familiar milk, and being cherished with warmth it has been
accustomed t0, and its being forced to accustom itsels to theseos
a strangerl Wheat being sown in a strange soil degeneratos into oats
or small wheat A vine being transplanted into another hill changes
its nature. A plant when-it is plucked from its parcnt earth withero,
aud as it were dies away, aud does· iu a manner the-same when it is
transplanted from its native earth. Fa. Nay, but they say planta
that have been transplanted and grafted lose their wild nature, and
produce better fruit. Eu. But not as soon as ever they peep out of
the ground, good madam.

There will come a time, a grace of God, when you will send away
your young son from you out of deors to be accomplished with learn-
ing and undergo harsh discipline, and which indeed is rather the
province of the father than os the mother, but now its tender age calls
for indulgence And besides, whereas the sood, according as it is, con·
tributas much to the health and strength of the body, so more especially
it is essentia] to take care with what milk that little, tendor, soit body
be sessoned. For Horace’s saying takes place here, What ia bred in
