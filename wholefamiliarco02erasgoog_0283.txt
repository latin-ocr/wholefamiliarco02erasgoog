the consent of the people; but this was not done because it was
necessary, but that he might render them the more criminal in not
keeping it. For, indeed, it is an impudent thingto break a law that
you gave your approbation ιο the making oi

And in the last place, inasmuch as human laws commonly concern
corporal matters, and are schoolmasters ιο piety, they seem ιο cease
when a person has arrived to that strength in grace that he does not
stand in need of any such restraints, but only should endeavour ιο
avoid giving an offence to weak persons who are conscientiously
scrupulous. As, for instance, suppose asather enjoins a daughter that
is under ago not ιο drink wine, that she may with the greater safety
preserve her virginity till she is married, when she comes of age, and
is delivered up to a husband, she is not bound to her father’s injunc-
tion. There are many laws that are like medicamenta, that aro altered
and give place according to the circumstances, and that with the appro-
bation of the physicians themselves, who, if they should at all times make
use of the remedies the ancients prescribed, would kill more than they
cure. Fi. You, indeed, heap a great many things together, some of
which Ι like and others Ι do not, and some Ι do not understand.

Bu. If a bishop's law manifestly savours of gain,÷thst is, if he
makes an order that every parish priest every year purchase st a guinea
apiece a right of absolution in those cases thot arc called episcopale,
that he might extort the more money from those in his jurisdiction,--
do you think it ought to be obeyodl ri. Yea, I think it ought; but
at the same time we ought ιο exclaim against this unjust law, but
always avoiding sedition. But how comes it about thot you turn
catechiser nt this rate, butoherl Every one should keep to his own
trade. Bo. We are often perplcxed with these questions at table,
and sometimes the contest proceeds ιο blows and bloodshed. Fi.
Well, let them fight that love fighting, I think we ought with rever·
enee to receive the lawe of our superiora, and religiously observa them
as coming from God 3 nor is it either sose or religious either ιο conceive
in mind or sow among others any sinister suspicion concerning them.
And if there bo any tyranny in them that does not compel us to im-
piety, it is better ιο bear it than seditiously to resist it.

Bu. I consess this is a very good way ιο maintain tho authority of
persons in power 3 I am pretty much of your mind, and ss for them, I
do not envy them. But I should be glad to hear anytliing whereiu
the liberty and advantage of the people is aimed at. Fi. God will
not be wanting ιο His people. Bu. But where all this while is that
liberty of the spirit that the apostles promise by the gospel, and which
Paul so often incolentes, saying, “ The kingdom of God consiste not in
meat and drink ;'' and that we are not children under a schoolmsster,
and that we do no longer serve the elementa of this world, and abun-
dance of other expressions: if Christiana are tiod to the observance of
so many more ceremonias than the Jews wore, and if the laws of man
bind more closely than a great many commanda of Godl Fi. Well,
butcher, I will tell you, the liberty of Christiana does not consist in its
being lawful for them to do what they will, being set free from human
ordinances, but in that they do those things that are enjoined them
with ο fervour ol spirit and readiness of mind willingly and chael-fully,
and ao are sons rather than servants.
