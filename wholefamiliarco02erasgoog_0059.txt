Christiane unless they hear mass, as they call it, every day. Ga„
Indeed Ι don’t condemn the practice in those that have time enough,

³ and spend whole days in profane exercises ; but Ι only disapprove 01

those who superstitiously fancy that that day must nocds be 0111οο
tanate to them that they hav'e not began with the mass3 and presently
01100 divine service is over they go either ιο trading, 0010100, 00 the
court, where whatsoever succeeds, though done justly 00 unjustly, they
attribute to the mass. It’r. Are there any persons that are so absurdi
Ga. The greatest part 01 mankind.

Er. But return to divine service. Ga. Ι1Ι 000 Ι 001 to stand
so close by the holy altar that I can hear what the priest reads,
especially the epistle and the gospel; from these Ι endeavour to pick
something, which I fix in my mind, and this I ruminate upon 100
sometime. Er. Don’t you pray at all in the meantimel Ga. Ido
prsy, but rather mentally than vocally. From the things the priest
reads Ι take occasion 01 prayer. Er. Explain that a little more. Ι
don't well take in what you mean. Ga. Ι will tell you; suppose this
epistle was read, “ Purge out the old leaven, that ye may he a new
lump, as ye are unleavened.'' On occasion 01 these words Ι thus
'address myself 10 Christ, “I wish Ι were the unleavened hread, pure
from all 100000 01 malice; but do thou, 0 Lord desua, who alone art
pure and free from all malice, grant that I may every day more and
more purge out the old leaven.” Again, 11 the gospel chance to he
read concerning the sower sowing his seed,I thus pray with myself,
“ Happy is he that deserves to be that good ground, and Ι pray that
01 barren ground He 01 Η10 great goodness would make me good
ground, without whose blessing nothing 01011 is good.'' These, 100
example sake, 100 11 would be tedicus to mention everything. But 11
Ι happen to meet with a dumb priest, such as there are many in
Germany, 00 that Ι cannot get near the altar, Ι commonly get a little
book that has the gospel of that day and epistle, and this Ι either say
out aloud or run it over with my eye.

Er. Ι understand 3 but with what contemplatione chiefly dost
thou pass away the timel Go. I give thanks to J esus Christ sor
His unspeakable love, in condescending to redcem mankind by His
death3 I pray that He would not suffer His most holy blood to be shcd
in vain for me, but that with His body He would always seed my soul 3
and that with His blood He would quicken my spirit, that, growing
by little and little in the increase 01 0000001 may be made a fit
member 01 His mystical body, which is the church; nor may ever 1011
10001 that holy covenant that He made with His elect disciples at the
last supper, when He distributed the hrcad and gave the cup ; and
through these, with all who are engraffed into His society by baptism.
Andii Ι find my thoughts to wander,I read some psalma, 0000010
01000 matter, that may keep my mind from wandering. Er. Have
you any particular psalma 100 this purposel Ga. Ι have; but Ι have
not so tied myself up to them but that Ι can omit them if any medita·
tion comes into my mind that 10 more 001000111ηο than the recitation 01
those salma

Epr. What do you do as to 10011001 Ga. I have nothing to do
with tasting ; for 00 J erome has taught me, that health is not to ba
impaired by tasting unt-il the body is arrived at its 1011 strength. 1
