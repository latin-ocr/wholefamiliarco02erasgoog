198 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.
Mo. Oh, how happy had we been if the fatas had not envied the earth

, the happiness of so great a man. What a patron was he to all liberal

studies! How candid a favourer of ingenuity! But he has left two
brothers, Gilos, a man of admirable judgment and wisdom, and J erome.
At. We know very well that J eromo is singularly well accomplished
with all manner of literature, and adorned with every kind of virtue.
Mu. But the destinies will not suffer him to be long-lived neither,
though no man in the world better deserves to be immortalised. sl.
How do you knowthatl Mar. We had it from Apollo Al. How
envious are the destinies, to take from us all desirable things so hastilyf
Mu. We must not talk of that at this time 3 but this Jerome, dying
with great applause, will leave his whole estate for the building of a
college at Louvain, in which most learned men shall profess and teach
publicly and gratis the three languages. These things will bring a
great ornament to learning, and glory to Oharles himself. Thea we
will reside at Louvain with all 0111101111.

Αἱ. But whither are you going nowl Mo. To Antwerp. Al.
What, the Muses and the Graces going to a fairl Mo. No, we assure
you, we are not going to a fair, but to a wedding. Ar. What have
virgins to do at weddingsl 1111. It is no indecent thing at all for
virgins to he at such a wedding as this is. Ac. Pray what sort of a
marriage is 111 Mu. A holy, undefiled, and ohaste marriage, such
sone as Pallas herself need not to be ashamed to be at: nay, more
than that, we believe she will be at it. Al. May not a person know
the bride and bridegroom’s namel Mo. We believe you must needs
know that most courteous and accomplished youth in all kinds of
polite learning, Peter AEgidius. At. You have named an angel, not
aman. illu. The pretty maid Cornelia, a fit match for Apollo him-
self, is going to be married to AEgidius. Al. Indead, he has been a
great admirer of you, even from his infancy. Mra We are going to
sing him an epithalamium. Ae. What, and will tho Graces dancc
tool Mo. They will not only dance, hut they will also unite those
two true lovers with the indissoluble ties of mutual affection, that 110

· differenee or jarring shall ever happon between thern. she shall never

hear anything from him but my life, nor he from her but my soul.
Nay; aud 01011 old age itself shall be so sar from diminishing that, that
it shall increase the pleasure.

Al. Ι should wonder at it, if those that live so sweetly could ever
bo able to grow old. 111. Yon say very right, for it is rather a
maturity than an old age. Al. But I have known a great many to
whom those kind words have been changed into quite the contrary in
less than three months’ time, and instead of pleasant jaste at table dishes
and trenchers have flown about. The husband, instead of my dcar
soul, has been called bloekhead, toas-pot, swill·tub; and the wife, sow,
fool, dirty drab. Mu. Yon say very true, but these marriages were
made when the Graces were out of humour. But in this marriage a
sweetness of temper will always maintain a mutual affection Al.
Indeed, you speak of such a happy marriage as is very seldomseen.
Mu. An uncommon felicity is due to such uncommon viltues.

Ar. But what! will the matrimony be without J uno and Venus 1
Ma. Indead J uno will not be there; she is a scolding goddess, and is
but seldom in a good humour with her own Jove. Nor, indeed, that
