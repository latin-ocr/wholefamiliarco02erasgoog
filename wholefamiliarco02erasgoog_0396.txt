CONOERNING FRIENDSHIP. 389

days after, we had the, pleasure to see her revenge herself} Jo. I am
glad at my 111111Ι 3 but prithee, how was itl
Ep. We happened to be walking near the same place, and the ser-
pent had been drinking at a spring hard by, for it was 11, violent hot
westher, that we were like to perish with thirst A boy ofabout thirteen
years old, the man’s son where we lodged, having fied from Bononia for
fear of the pestilenoe, happened very luokily to eome by with a hay·
sake upon his shoulder; as soon as he saw the serpent he ories out.
Jo. Perhaps for fear. Ep. No3 for joy, rejoieing that he had found
the enemy. The boy strikes him with the sake, the serpent rolls him-
self up, buthe laid on, till having broke his head, the serpent stretohed
himself out, which they never do but when they are dying; that is
the reason that you have heard the apologist eonoerning a crab-tish,
who killing a serpent that was his enemy, when he saw him stretehed
out, saysthus, You ought to have gone 1ο, when you were alive. Jo.
That was bravely done 3 but how thenl Ep. The boy takes him upon
his rake, and hange him upon a shrub over the caye, and in a few days’
time we saw the leaves tinctured with the blood of the serpent The
husbandmen of that place related to us a wonderful strange thing for
a certain truth 3 that the oonntrymen being weary sometimes, sleep in
that field, and have sometimes with them a pitcher of milk, whioh
serves both foi· victuals and drink3 that serpente are great lovers of
milk, and so it often happens that they come in their way. But they
have a remedy for that Jo. Pray, what is itl Ep. They daub the
brims of the pitcher with gallio, and the smell of that drives away tho
ser ents.
pJo. What does Horace mean, then, when he says garlio is a poison
more hnrtful than henbane‚ when you say it is an antidote against

poisonl Ep. But hear a little, I have something to tell you that is .

worse than that. They often creep slily into the mouth of a man that
lies sleeping with his mouth open, aud so wind themselves into his
stomaeh. Jo. And does not a man die immediately that has enter-
tained such a guestt Ep. No, but lives most miserably ; nor 11 there
any remedy hut to feed theman with milk, and other things that the
serpent loves. Jo. What, uo remedy against suoh 1 calamityl Ep.
Yes, to eat abundanee of garlic. ι11. N o wonder, then, mowers love
garlic. Ep. But those that are tired with heat and labour have. their
remedy another way; for, when they are in danger of this misfortune,
very often a lizard, though but a little creature, saves a man. Jo.
How can he save bimi Ep, When he peroeives a serpent lying pen.
due in wait for the man, he runs about upon tho man's neck and face,
and never gives over till he has waked the man by tiokling him, and
olawing him gently with his nails; and as soon as the man wakes, and
sees the lizard near him, he knows tho enemy is somewhore not sar off
, in ambusoade, and looking about seizes him Jo. Tho. wonderful
power of nature 1

Ep. Now, there is no living ereatura that is so great an enemy to
man as a crocodile, who oftentimes devours men whole, and assiste 1111
maliee by an artifice ; having sucked in water, he makes the patha Ι

slippery where they go to the Nile to draw water, and when they fall
down, there swallows them up. Nor ean you bo ignorant that delphius

that live in a quite different elepnpnt are great lovers of meu Jo.
