mariners they were singing their Salve Regina, imploring the virgin
mother, calling her the star 01 the sea, the queen of heaven, the lady
01 the world, the haven 01 health, and many other flattering titles,
which the sacred scriptures never attributed to her. Ant. What
hash shefto do with the sea, who, as I believe, never went a voyage
in er li al

Adel. In ancient times Venus took care 01 1101111010, because she
was believed to be born 01 the sea, and because she left off to take care
01 them, the virgin mother was put in her place, that was a mother, but
nota virgin. Ant. You joke. Adel. Some were lying along upon
the boards worshipping the sea, pouring all they had into it, and
flattering it, as if it had been some incensed prinae. 1101. What did
they sayl 111101. Oh, most merciful sea! Oh, most genereus sea!
Oh, most rich sea! Oh, most beautiful sea, be pacified, save us, and
a deal 01 such stuff they sung to the deas ocean 1101. Ridiculous
superstition! What did the rest dol s

adol. Some did nothing bnt spue, and some made vows. There ἱ
was an Englishman there that promised golden mountains to our Lady 1
01 Walsingham, so he did but get ashore alive. Others promised a
great many things to tho wood 01 the cross which was in such a place,
others again to that which was in such a place, and the same was
done by the Virgin Mary which reigns in a great many places 3 and 1
they think the vow is 01110 effect unless the place be mentioned.
Aac. Ridiculousl as 11 the saints did not dwell in heaven. Adel.

7Some made promises to become Canthusians. Thero was ono who

promised he would go a pilgrimage 10 St. J ames at Compostella bare
1001 and baro-headed, clothed in a ooat 01 mail, and begging his bread
all the way. Ant. Did nobody make any mention 01 st. Christopherl
Adol. Yes, Ι heard one, and I could not forbear laughing, who, bawling
out aloud, lest St. Christopher should not hear him, promised him
who is at the top 01 a church at Paris, rather a mountain than a ⁴
statuo, a wax taper aa big as he was himself. When he had bawled
out this over and over as loud as he could, an acquaintance 01 his
jogged him on the elbow and cautioned him: Have a aare what you
promise, 101 if you should 0011 011 you have in the world you will not be ·
able to pay 10111 He answered him softly, lest St. Christopher should '
hear him, You fool, says he, do you think Ι mean as I speak; if 1 once
got saleto shore, 1 would not give him aa much as a tallow candle.
Aa. Oblockhead! Ι fancy he was a Hollander. Adel. No, he was a
Zealander. Ant. I wonder nobody thought 01 St. Paul, who hasbeen
at sea, and having suffered shipwreck leapt on shore; 101110 being not
unacquainted with tho distress knows how to pity those that are in it.
Adel. He was not so much as named

aaa Were they at their prayers all the whilel 111101 Ay, as 11
11 had been 101 a wager. One sung his Hail Quaen, another, I believe
in God. There were some who had certain particular prayers not
unlike magical oharms against dangers. Aut. How affliction makes
men religiousl In prosperity we neither think 01 (lod nor saint.
But what did you do all this whilel Did you not make vows 10 some
saintsl Adel. No, none at all. 1101. Why sol Adol. Imako no
bargaina with saints. For what is this but a bargain in forml 1 will
