THE UNEQUAL BANQUET. 305

speak to them with a cheerful countenance, ordering your speech

according to each person’s age and humour. Sp. I will come nearer
to you that I may hear the better. Ap. You understand languagesl
Sp. Yes, most languagea Ap. Yon must ever and anon speak to
every one in his own tongue; and that the entertainment may be the
more diverting by a variety ol stories, intermix such matters as every
one will remembcr with pleasure, and nobody will be uneasy to hear.
Sp. What sort of matters mean yout

Ap. The peculiar differences of dispositione, which you yoursell'
are better versed in 5 Ι will only touch upon some heads. Old men
take a pleasure in relating those things tbat are ont of the memory of
many persons, and are admirere of those times in which they were in
their prime. Itis a pleasant thing to a married woman to have the
memory of that time refreshed when sbe was courted by her sweet-
hearts. Mariners that have been in divers and far distant countries
take a pleasure to tell of those things that they have seen and other
people admira at, and according to the proverb, the remembrance of
dangers when they are over is very pleasant, if they are such as have
nothing opprobrions in them, as in the army, in travels, in the dangers
at sea And in the last place, every one loves to talk of his own call-
ing, especially in that part that hc excels in. These are some general
heads3 as to particular allections it is not possible to describe them;
but, sor example sake, one is ambitibus of honour, another would be
accounted learned, another loves to be taken for a rich man; one is full
ol talk, another is sparing of his speech, some will be surly, others, on
the other hand, affable, some do not care to be thought old when they
are so, and some would sain be thought older than thoy are, affecting to
be admired for carrying tbeirage well. Some women plesse themselves
mightily in being thought handsome‚ and some love to be flattered.
These dispositione being known, it will 'he no difficult matter so to
intermix speeches as to be pleasing to every one, and to avoid those
things that cause uncasincss

Sp. Upon my troth, you are excellently skilled in· the art of order-
ingan entertainment. Ap. Phoo! If l bad spent as much time and
taken as much pains in the study of tho law, physic, or divinity, as I
have spent upon this art, I had long before now commenced doctor of
them all. Sp. Iam of your mind. Ap. But, hark ye, that you may
not mistake‚ you must be sure to take care that your stories be not
long-winded ones, and that they do not turn upon drunkenness3 foras
there is nothing better than wine drank with moderation, so, on the
other hand, there is nothing worse if you drink too much. It istbe
same in stories. Sp. Yon say right. But what remedy have you
for thiel

Ap. When you perceive any disposed to be quarrelsome‚ take an
opportunity to break off abruptly from what you were saying, and talk
of something else. I take it to be unnecessary to cantion you against
bringing any one’s afflictior to his mind during tbe time of tbe enter·
tainment. Plato is os opinion that banquets will cure some distempers,
the wine driving away sorrow and making persons sorgct what caused
uneasiness to them. But you ought to be cautioned of this, not to
salute the guests too osten ; yet I would have you welk about some-
times, and speak kindly first to one and then to another, sor a muter
