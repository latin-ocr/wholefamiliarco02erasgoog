THE PROFANE BANQUET. ’17

hang yourself, you pimp. I value you as littleas you do me. He
that shall give a farthing for you huys you too dear. But Ι will be
sold for more, or Ι won’t be sold at all. If you would be sold at a
great rate you must get you a mask, for those wrinkles in your fore·
head won't let you be sold for much. He that won’t give so much
for me shall not have me. I would not give a straw for you I
costmore.

A Tmen Eranusa-I have been at an auctiori to-doy. Say you
sol Ibid money forashare in the customs. But how muclrl Ten
thousand pounds. Whoo! what, somuchl There were those that bid
a great deal more; very few that offered less. Well‚ and who had tho
place at last 1 Chremes, your wife's great friend. But guess what it
was sold for. Ten Nay, fifteen. Ο good Godl Ι would not give
half so much for him and all his family together. But he would give
twice as much sor your wife.

“ Do you take notice, that in all these, wheresoever there is a
substantive of the price, that is put in the ablativo case 3 but that the
restare either put in the genitive case, or are changed into adverbs.
You have never heard a comparative without a substantivo, except in
these two, pluris and ricinoris. There are some other verbs, of which
we have spoken, that are not very much uulike these, aum, socio, habeo,
' duco, oestimo, pendo, which signify (in a manner) the something, like-
wise fio, aud they are for the most part joined with these genitivos,
multi, magni ,· porei, pluris, plurimi ,· minor-is, oriniaci, narrabat ,· tanti,
quanti; flocci, pila· nihili, noua, liujus, and any other like them.'' Oh.

Vaterno—rna Fora—Aa. Do you know how much I have
always valued youl You will always be made of such account by men
as yon make account of virtue. Gold is valued at a great rate now-a
days; learning is valuerl at a very little, or just nothing at all. lvalue
gold less thau you think for. ,’[ don'tvalue your threats a rusb. I
make a very little account of your promises. I don'tvalue you a
hair. If wisdom were but valued at so greatarate as money, nobody '
would want gold. With us gold without wisdom is esteerned to be of
more worth than wisdom without gold. Iesteonr you at a greater rate,
because you are learned. You will bo the less esteerued on here because
you don't know how to lie. Here are a great many that will persuade
you that black is white. I sot the greater velue upon you because you
love learning. So much as you have, so much you shall be esteemcd by
all men: so much as you have, so much you shall be accounted of
everywhere. It is no matter what you are accouuted‚ but what you
are. I value my Christian above any man else in the world.

“There are some other verbs found with these genitivos and
ablatives‚ which in their own nature don't siguisy buying, or any-
thing like it‘' Peter bought a kiss of the maid for a shilling. Much
good may it do him. Iwould not kissatthat rate. How much do ⁴
you play forl What did you pay for supperl We read of some that
have spent six hundred sesterces for a supper. But the French often
sup for a halfpenny. What price does Faustusteach forl A very
small matter. But for more than Delius. For how much thoul For
nineteen guineas. Iwill not learn to lie at so dear a rate. Phaedra
