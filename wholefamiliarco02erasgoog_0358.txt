report this to the people of Athens, and then let them judge which has
the greater soul of the two, I who heard this patiently or he who spoke
it saucily. Where arc now our monarcha who think themselves equal
to the gods themselves, and for a single word spoken over a glass of
wine will immediately wage warl The thirst of glory is very im·
petuous, and many are carried away by the violence ol it. One of
that number put the questionto Socrates, Which was the shortest
way ιο get a good reputationl Το whom he answered, If you shall
behave yourself like such an one as you would be accounted to be.

Jo. In troth, I do not know what could be said more concisely
and to the purpose. A good nome is not ιο be obtained by wishing
for, but is a concomitant of virtue, as infamy is of improbity. You
have been admiring of men; but the Laconian maid charmcd me, who
being ιο be sold at a sale, the person who was to buy ber came ιο her
and asked her, If I buy you, will you be honesti She answered, Yes,
lwill, whether you buy me or not ; intimating that she retained an
