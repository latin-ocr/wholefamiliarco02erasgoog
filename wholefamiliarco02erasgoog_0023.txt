eating of fich, but our ancestors thought otherwise, and it is our duty
to obeythern. And presently, in the same place, 1 teaeh, But the ’

It is es false that the favour of the blessed Virgin and other saints
ere drolled upon iu my Colloquies, hut I deride those who beg those
things ol the saints which they dare not ask of a good man ; or pray tc
certain saints with this notiori, as if this or that saint either could or
would sooner grant this or that thing than another saint or Christ ·
himself would do. Yea, and in the Child’s Piety the lad speaks thus,
I salute J esus again in three words, and all the saints, either men or
women, but the Virgin Mary by name, and especially that I soccum
most peculiarly my own And afterwards he mentions by name
what saint he salutes daily. And is it· any strange thing that a suitor
to a young maid should commend a married life, and says, That chaste
wedlock does not come far short of virginityl Especially when St.
Aust-in himself prefers the polygamy of the patriarchs before our
sin le life. ·

gAs to what they object eoueerning the entering into a religious
life, my words declaro how plainly vain it is in the virgin hating
marriage; for the maid speaks thus, Are you then in the main against
the institution of a monastic lifel The young man answers, N o, by no
means, but as I will not persuade anybody against it, that is already
engaged in this sort of life, to endeavour to get out of it, so Ι would
most undoubtedly cantion all young women, especially those of genereus
tempere, not to precipitata themselves unadvisedly into that state, from
whence thereis no getting out afterwards This is the conclusion of
that Colloquy, however they had disputed before. Pray, does this
dissuade from entering upon a religione lifel The eutering into it is not
condemned, but the unadvised rashnoss of it. Therelore, they malici·
ously wrest my words in order to reproach me. But, at the same time,
they do not animadvert how many things young students thence learn
that oppugn the opinions of the Lutherans.

In the Ohildish Piety the way of hearing the mass well snd profit-
ably is taught, and the true and effeetual way of confession is shewn
Young studente are there instructed that those things that are used by
Christiane, though they are not found in the scripturos, must never·
tlrsless be observed, lest we give occasiones offence to any person.

In the Profane Feast they are instructed that they ought rather to
obey the institutions of popes than the prescriptione of physicians,
only they are given to understand that in case of necessity the force of
a human law cesses, and the intention of the lewgiver. There a
certain person approves of liberality towards the eolleges of monks, if
men give for real use, and not to support luxury, and especially if given
to those that observe the discipline of religion.

· In the Colloquy eoueerning Eating of Fish, this is said eoueerning
human institutions—well, let them light that love fighting ; I think
we ought with reverenee to receive the laws of our superiora, and reli·
giously observe them as coming from God 5 nor is it either ssfe or
religious either to conceive in mind or sow among others any sinister
suspicion concerning them, and if there is any superstition in them
that does not eompel us to impiety, it is better to bear it than sedi·
tiously to resist.
