Eo. But St Paul teaehes that wives ought 1ο he subject 10 their

own husbands with all reverence. And St. Peter proposes the example

' 01 Sarah to ua, who called her husband, Abraham, lord. Xa. I have

heard those things ; but the 101110 Paul likewise teaehes that men
should love their wives as Christ loved his sponse the ehureh. Let
him remember his duty and 1 will remember mine. su. But, never-
theless, when things are come to that pass that 0116 must submitto the
other, it is but reasonable that the wife submit to her husband. Xe.
Yes, indeed, if he deserves the name 01 0 husband who uses me like a
kitchen weneh. Eua But tell me, Xantippe, did he leave off threaten-

cr else 110 would have been thrashed. Eu. But did not you leave 011
scolding at 1111111 Xe. N o, nor never will. lta. But what does he
do in the meantimel Χα. What! Why, sometimes he pretends
himself 10 be 1011 asleep, and sometimes dces nothing in the world but
laugh at me; sometimes he catehes up his fiddle, that has but three
stringe, seraping upon it with all his might, and drowns the noise 01
my bawling. se. And does not that vex you to the heartl Xa.
Ay, 10 that it is impossible to be expressed, so that sometimes I ean
100100 keep my hands 011 01 him.

1110 Well, my Xantippe, give me leave 10 talk a little freely with
you. Xa. Ido give you leave Eu. 1101, you shall use the same
1100110111 with 1116. Our intimacy, which has been in a manner 110111
