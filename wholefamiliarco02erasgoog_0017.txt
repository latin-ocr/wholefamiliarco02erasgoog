11 PREFACE.

deliberate about choosing a kind 01 1110, and 10 make choica of a priest
10 whom you may commit your 3001013, Ijudged it to be necessary for
young men; nor do Ι 300 any reason why Ι should repent of it. But
if so, there will be fewcr monks and priests. It may be so ; but then, -
perhaps, they will be better, aad whosoever is a monk indeed will

prore it so. And besides, they who endeavour to make men be 01
their own persuasion, either for the sake of their own gain or supersti-
tion, do very well deservo to be delamed by the waitings 01 011 men,
that they may ha brought to repentance.

In the Profane Banquet, 1 condemn not 1110 ordinances of the
ohurch concerning fasta and choica 01 1110013 ; but Ι point cut 110
superstition of some men, who lay more 311033 on these things than
they ought todo, and neglect those things that are moro conducive
to piety. And I condemn the oruelty of them who require strictly
these things 01 11030 persons from whom the meaning of the churoh
does not exact thern 3 and also the preposterous holiness of those per·
sons who condemn their neighbour for such things Here, if any one
shall consider how great a mischief among rnen accrues hence to godli·
ness‚ he will confess that scarae any other admonition is 111010 110003-
sary. But in another place Ι shall give a fuller answer 10 1113
matter.

In the Religious Banquet, although I make them all laymen, and
all married men, yet 1 sufficiently shew what sort 01 feast that 01 all
Christiana ought to bo. With which pattern, if some monks and
priests compare their feasts, they will perceive how far short they fall
01 1101 perfeetion in which they ought 10 01100011 leymen.

In the canonization, 1 show what honour is due to mon 01 excel-
lancy, who have well deserved hy their studies 01 110 liberal arts.

They are foolish who think that 110 Colloquy between the Maid
and her Sweetheart is lasciviens, whereas nothing ean be imagined more
chaste, if wedlook be an honest thing, and it bc honest to 10 0 wocer.
And I could wish that all wooers were such as I suppose one in this
Colloquy 10 10, and that marriages were contractod with nc other dis-
courses. What can you do with those 01 0 sour disposition, and averso
10 all pleasant discourse, who think all that is friendly and 111011)ν is
unchastel This young maid refuses to give her swcetheart a
kiss at his departure, that she may preserve her virginity for him

Besides, they do not 00100110 how many philosophical sayings are inter-
mixed with josts concerning marriages 30 hastily mado up 3 concerning
the choice 01 bodies, but nauch 111010 01 minds; concerning the firmncss
01 matrimony; concerning not contracting marriages without the con·
30111 01 parents, and 01 keeping them chastely; of the religious educa·

’ tlon of children: and inthe last place, theyoung maid prays, that

Christ by his favour would make their marriage happy. Is it not fit
that young men and maids should know those thingsl And persons
who think that this lesson is hartful 10 children, by 10030101 110 wan·
