my belly with capons and partridges. Ca. In a great many circum-
stances it 10 not the thing, but the mind that distinguishes 00110111
Jews. They held their hands from certain 1110010, as from unelean things
that would pollute the mind ; but we, understanding that “ to 1110 pure
all things are purc,’' yet take away food 110111 1110 wauton 110011, as we
do hay from s pampered horse, that it may bc more ready to hearken
to the spirit. We sometimes chastise the immoderate use 01 pleasant
things, by the pain of abstinence. 111οΙ hear you, but by the same
argument, circumcisiones the 110011 may be defended, 101 that moderates
the itch 01 coition, and brings pain 11 011 hated fish as bad as I do, I
would scarce put a parricide to so much torture. Ob. Some palates arc
better pleased with fish than flesh. Aac. Then they like those things
that plesse their gluttony, but don't make 101 their health.

00111010 heard 01 001110 01 the AEsope and Apitius's that have
lookcd upon fist as the greatest delicacy. Au. How then do dainties
agree with punishmentl Ol.. Everybody have not lampreys‚ scares,
and sturgeons. Au. Then itis only the poor folks that arc tormented‚
with whom itis bad enough 11 they were permitted to 001 110011 3 aud
it 011011 happens that when they may eat flesh 1011110 01101011, they cannot

the prohibition 01 110011 be turned to delicious living to the 11011, and
if the poor cannot 001 110011 many times when otherwise they might,
1101 00111101 001 fish because they are commonly 1110 1100101, 10 whom
does the injunction do goodl Ch. 'l'o all, 101 poor 101110 may cat
cockles or frogs, or may gnaw upon 01110110 01 leeks. The middle sort
01 people will make some abatement 111 their usual provisiou 5 and
though the rich do make it an occasion 01 living deliciously, they ought
to imputa that to their gluttony, aud not blame 1110 constitution 01
the church. Aa. You have said very well, 1111101011 that, to requiro
abstinence 1100111θο1101 poor folks who seed their families by the sweat

their bodies may be less fierce against the spirit. Aa. The moderate
use 01 110011 would effect that. Cb. But in so great avaricty 01 bodies

There are 1101100 that yield much aliment, aud there ars sorte 01 110011
that yield but little. ot. But in general 11001110 most nourishing.
