to wear a transparent garment. J ank. I fancy that the whole of this
matter of apparel depeuds upon custom and the opinion of people.
Cora Why sol Innle. It is not many days ago since some travellers
lodged at my house, who said that they had travelled through diverse
countries lately discovered, which are wanting in the ancient maps. ·
They said they came ιο an island of a very temperate air, where they
looked upon it as the greatest indecency in the world to cover their
bodies. Oen. It may be they lived like beante. Idale. Nay, they
said they lived a life of great humanity—they lived under a king, they
attended him to work every morning daily, but not above an honr in s
⁴ day. Ocra What work did they dol [ποι. They pluckedupacertain
sort of rocta, that serves them instead of bread, and is more pleasant
and more wholesome thau bread; and when this was done they every
one went to his business, what they had a mind to do. They bring up
their children religiously, they avoid and punish vices, hut none more
severely than adultery. Con. What is the punishmentl Inalr.
They forgive the women, for it is permitted to that scx 3 but for men
that are taken in adultery this is the punishment, that all his life after
he should appear in public with his privy parts covered. Coa. A
mighty punishment indeed. Inna Custom has made it to them the
very ddidtllihldldnlsddddiiieilihtellorce of persuasion‚ I am almost ready
· to allow it. For if a man would exposa a thies oramurderer to the
greatest ignominy, would it not be a sufficient punishment to cut off a
piece of the hindcr part of his clothes, and sew a piece of a wolfs skin

his shoulders and his brcast bare, to shave off one side of his board

than to put on him a fool’s cap with long ears and bellsl And yet
soldiers dress themselves every day in this trim, and are well enough
pleased with themselves, and find fools enough that like the dress too,
though there is nothing more ridiculous. Inak. Nay‚ there are
topping citizens too who imitate them as much as they can possibly.
Con. But now if a man should dress himself up with hirds' feathers
like an Indian, would not the very boys all of them think he was a
madmaul Innk. Stark mad.

Coo. And yet that which we admira savours of a greater madness
still Now, as it is true that nothing is so ridiculous but custom will
hear it out, so it cannot be denied but that there is a certain decorum

dragging a long train at her heels, as if her quality ware to be measured
by the length of her taill And yet some cardinals are not ashamed to
follow this fashion in their gowns‚ and so prevalent a thing is cnstom
that there is no altering of a fashion that has once obtained. Inak.
Well, we have had talk enough about custom; hut tell me now
