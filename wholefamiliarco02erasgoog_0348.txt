ΤΗΕ ASSEMBLY OB PABLIAMENT OF Wolters. 341

emperor had a parliament of men to consult of their common affairs,
so hie mother Augusta should have her parliament of women to trans·
act the affairs of their own sex; which the men, either by way oi
drollery or distinction, called the little senate. This precedent, which
has been omitted ior so many years, the present posture of our affairs
obliges us to revive. Neither- let any one be scrupulous, because the

of women. Otherwise, if women must always hold their tongues, to
what purpose did Nature give them, which are as voluble as men’s, and a
voice that is shrillerl although they make ahoarser sound, and thereby
resemble asses more than weda. But this ought to be the care of us
all, to manage our debates with that gravity, that the men may not call
eur assembly a conventiale, or by some other more scandalous name,
and they are used to ba iorward enough to be scurrilous in their lan·
guage to us3 although, if one might estimato their parliamenta accord·
ing to truth, they will appear more womanish than the assemblies of
women themselves.

We see monarche have done nothing but fight for these Ι do not Ι
know how many years. The studente of divinity, priests, bishopa, and
people are at muggam-drawn, and there are as many opinions as there
are men in the world, and they are more inconsistent in them than we
women ourselves are. One city does not agree with another, nor one
neighbour with another. ΙΙ the supreme administration were antrusted
in our hands, I am mistaken if the world would not be managed at a
better rate than now it is. Perhaps it may not become our female
modesty to charge such noble personages with folly; butI suppose I
may be allowed to recite what Solomon has written in the thirteenth
chapter of his Proverbs: .“ There is always contentiori among the
proud‚ but they that do everything by counsel are governed by
wisdom.” ,

But that I may not detain you any longer with a tedicus pream-
ble, to the end that all things may ba carried on decently and without
confusion, in the first placa it will be necessary to consider who shall
be allowed as members, and who shall be excluded. For too great a

admitted as a m'ember ; because many things arey huppen to be debated
that are not proper for them to hear. Ja. But how shall we be able
to know who are virgins and who are nott Will you allow all
those to be virgins that pass for suchl 00. N o; but my meaning is,
that none but married women be admittedamong us. Ja. But there
arc virgins among those that arc married3 such as have fumblers sor
their husbands 00. Well, but this honour shall be allowed tc a
married state, that all that have been married shall be allowed to be
women. «10. Under your favour, if you exclude none but virgins, we
shall still have too grem a number.

00. Well, then, those shall be excluded that have been more than
thrice married. Ju. For what reasonl 00. Because they ought to.
have their qaam cst, as being superannuated. And Ι am of opinion

that we ought to do the same by those that ara upwards of seventy years
