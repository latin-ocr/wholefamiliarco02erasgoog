Ihave heard every famous story of 0 boy who was beloved by cne;
and a more famous one than that, about Arion. Ep. Βο011100 that, in
catching mullets 1110 fishermen make nse of the assistance 01 delphine
instead of dogs, and when they have caught their prey, give them part
for their pains. Nay, more than that, they suffer themselves to be
chastised 11 they commit any fault in their hunting them. They fre-
quently appear to mariners at sea, rejoicing and playing upon the top
of 1110 waves ; sometimes swimming 101110 ship 011100, and leaping over
the spread sails, they are so delighted with the conversation 01 men.

But again, as a delphin is so very great a lover 01 111011, so he is a
11101101 enemy to the crocodile. He goes out of thesea, and dares to
venture into the River Nile, where 1110 crocodile domineers‚ and attacks
the monstrous animal thetis defended with teeth, olaws, and scales,
more impenetrable than iron, when he himself is not very well framed
101 biting neither, his mouth inclining to his breast. Yet, lo'r all that,
he runs violently upon his enemy, and coming near him, diveth down
011 0 sudden, gets under his belly, and setting up 1110 11110, pricks him in
1110 0011 part of his belly, which is the only place 110 ean be wounded in.
Jo. lt is a wonderful thing that an animal should know his enemy,
though he never saw him before in his life 3 and to know both why he
should be attached, and where he can be burt, and how to defend him-
self, when a man has 1101 that faculty, who would not have sense enough
to be afraid 01 0 basilisk, unless he were warned beforehand, and taught
by having received harm.

Ep, Aborae, you know, is a creature devoted to the service of
man ; and there 10 0 capital enmity between him and a bear, thetis an
enemy tc man, H'e knows his enemy, though he has never seen him
before, and presently preparcs himself to enguge him. Jo. What arms
does he fight withl Ep. Rather with art than strength He leaps
over the enemy, and strikes his hind legs 011 his head The bear, 0111110
other hand, claws at the 0011 part of the hcrse's helly. The poison of 011
asp is incurable to a man; and 1110 ichneumon makes war with the asp,
and is likewise a mortal enemy to the crocodilo. An elephant is 0100
very well affected towards mankind3 101 they very kindly shew the
way to a traveller that has happened to 1000 11, 01111 they know and
love their teacher. There are likewise examples of an extraordinary
love toward mankind ,for one 01 them fell in love with an Egyptian
maid that sold garlanda, and another loved Menander of Syracuse so
affectionatcly that he would not eat his victuale when he was out of
sight.

But not to mention any more cf this nature, though there is
abundance related: When King Bacchus had a mind to exercise his
arnelty toward thirty persons, he determined 10 expose them, bound to
stakcs, to so many elephants3 but they that were sent out among the
elephanta to provoke them could never bring them 10110 executionem
01 the king’s oruelty. There is likewise a very destructive antipathy
between this creature 00 friendly to mankind, and the Indian dragous,
which are reported to be the largest that are, sc that they ostentimes
both perish in the engagement There is the like disagreement between
the eagle and the lesser dragon, although it is harmless towards men,
as it has been reported to have borne amorous affectione towards certain
maidens. There is likewise a deadly enmity between the eagle and
