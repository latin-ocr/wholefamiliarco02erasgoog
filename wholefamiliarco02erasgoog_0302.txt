Ma. A very eompendious way of aceouutingl Pla. Thea he would
lengthen out the war, and raise contributione rnonthly, both from
friends and foes; from his enemies that they might not be plundered,
and from his friends that they might have cernmcrcs with the enemy.
Mo. I know the common way of soldiers; but make an end of your
story.

Ph. Bernardine and Vincent ataid with the sich man, and the rest
had their provisions sent them. Ma Wcll, and did they agree among
themselves that staid upon dutyl Pa Not very well 3 they continually
grumbled something about the prerogativa of their bulls 3 but they
were fain to dissemble the matter, that they might go the better on
with their werla Now the will is produced, and eovenants entered
into before witnesses, according to what they had agreed upon between
themselves. Ma. Ι long ιο hear what that was.

Pa. l will tell you in brief, for the whole would be along history.
He leaves a widow of thirty-eight years of age, a disereet, virtuous
woman; and two sons, the one of nineteen, and the other fifteen years
of age, and two daughters, both under age. He provided by this
testament, that his wife, seeing she would not bc prcvailed upon to
confine herself ιο a cloister, should put on the habit of a Beguin, which
is a middle order between a laic and a religiens3 and the eldest son,
because hc could not beprevailed upon toturn monh—Mo. Tlrereis '

funeral was over, be should ride post ιο Rome, and there being made
apricat before his time, by the pope's dispensation, he should say mass

soul, and creep up the holy steps thereupon his knees every Friday.

younger son was dedicated to St. Francis, his oldest daughter ιο st.
Clare, and the younger to Cathcrine Senensis. This was all that could
be obtained 3 for it was George's purpose that he might lay the greater
obligation upon God, ιο dispose of‘the five survivors into the five orders

aud his oldest son could not be wrought upon by any terma, either
fair or foul. Mo, Why, this is ahiud of disinheriting.

Ph. The whole estate was so divided, that the funeral charges
being first taken out, one twelfth-part of it was to go to his wife; one
half of that for her maintcnanea, and the other half to the stock of tho
place where she should dispose of herself, upon condition that, if she
should alter her mind, the whole should go to that order. Another

' twelfth was to go to the oldest son, who was to have so much money

paid him down upon the nsil as would bear the charges of his journey,
purchase him a dispensation, and maintain him at Rome; provided

always, that if he should at any time change his mind, and refuse to be
initiated into holy orders, his portion should be divided between the
-Franoiscans and Dominicans; and Ι fear that will he the end of it, for
he had a strange aversion to that course of life. Two twelfth·parts were
to go to the monastery that should reeeire his younger son, and two
