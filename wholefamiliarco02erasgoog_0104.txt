THE RELIGIOUS BANQUET. 97

pleasure has this life in itl Nay‚ rather, what pain has it notl But
if there were not, there would be undoubtedly in it satiety or trouble.

“ Iarn not for bewailing my past life ss a great many, and learned men

too, have done; nor do Ι repent that I have lived, because I have
lived so thatI am satisfied Ι have not lived in vain And when 1
leave this life, Ι leave it as an inn, and not as a place ο1 abode. For
Nature has given us our bodies as an inn to lodge in, and netto dwell
in. Oh! glorious day will that be, when I shall leave this rabble rout
and defilements of the world behind me, to go to that society and
world of spirits !¹’ Thus far ont of Cato. What could be spoken more
divinely by a Christiani Iwish all the discourses of our monks, even
with their holy virgins, were such as the dialogus of this aged pagan
with the pagan youths of his time.

aa. It may be objected that this colloquy of Tully’s was but a
fiction

Oa It is all one to me, whether the honour of these expressions
be given to Cato, who thought and spoke them, or to Cicero, whose
mind could form such divine things in contemplation, and whose pen
could represent such excellent matter in words so answerable ιο them ;
though indeed 1 am apt to think that Cato, if he did not speak these
very words, yet that in his familiar conversation he used words of the
very same import. For, indeed, M. Tully was not a man of that im-
pudence, to draw Cato otherwise than he was. Besides, that such an
unlikeness in a dialogue would have been a great indecorum, which
is the thing chiefly ιο be aimed at in this sort of discourse, and
especially at a time when his character was fresh in the memories of
all men.

Th. That which you say is very likely 3 but I will tell you what
came into my mind upon your recitat Ι have often admired with
myself that, considering that all rnen wish for long life and are afraid
of death, that yet I have scaros found any man so happy (I don't
speak of old, but ο1 middle-aged men) but that if the question were
put to him, whether or no, if it should be granted him to grew young

a true reflection upon the mixture of good and ill ο1 his past life. For
the remembrance even of the pleasantest part ο1 it is commonly
attended with shame and sting of conscience, insomuch that the

fable ο1 Lethe, ιο represent the dead drinking largely of the waters ο1
forgetfulness before their souls were affected with any desire ο1 the
bodies they had left behind them.

La. It is a thing well worthy of our admiration, and what I my·
self have observed in some persons. But that in Cato that pleases me
the mostis his declaration, “ N either am I sorry that I have lived.¹'
Where is the Christian that has so led bis life aa to be able to say as
much as this old mant Ιι is a common thing for men who have
scraped great estates together by hook or by crook, when they are

upon their deathbeds, and about ιο leave them, then to think they. ,
have not lived in vain. But Cato therefore thought that he had not
lived in vain upon the comcienoe of his having discharged all the parts .
