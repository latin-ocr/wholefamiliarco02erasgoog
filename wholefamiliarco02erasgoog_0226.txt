THE FABULOUS Batavus. 219 ,

Ρο. Τ101 was attempted afterwards, but now the magistrates knew
Maccus, Ge. What did Maccus say for himself l Po. Do you ask
what he said for himself 10 so good a cause as thiel The plaintiff was
in more danger than the defendant. Ge. How sol Po. Because he
arrested him in an action of defamation, and prosecuted him upon the
statute of Rheims, which says, that he that charges a man with what
he cannot prove shall suffer the penalty which the defendant was to
suffer 11 he had been convicted. He denicd that he had mcddled with
another man's goods without his leave, but that he put them upon
him, aud that there was no mention made 01 auything 010 price; but
that he challenged the shoemaker to run for awager, and that he
accepted the challenge, and that he had 00 reason to complain because
he had outrun him. Ge. This action was pretty much like that of the
shadow 01 110 000. Wcll, hut what theut Po. When they had had
laughing enough at the matter, one of the judges invites Maccus 10
supper, and paid the shoemaker his money.

Just such another thing happened a daventer when I was a boy.
It was st a time when it is the fishmonger's fair and the butchers¹ time
10 10 0101101. Α certain man stood 01 0 fruiterer's stall, or oporo-
polist’s, if you would have it in Greek. The woman was a very fat
woman, and he stared very hard upon the ware she had 10 0011 She,
according as the custum is, invites him 10 1010 what he had a mind
to; and perceiving he set his eyes upon some figs, Would you plesse
to bave figsl says she, they are very fine ones. He givos her a nod.
She asks him how many pounds ; Would you have five pounds, says shel
He nods again, she turus him five pounds 1010 110 apron. While
she is laying by her 000100, 10 walks off, 001 10 any great haste, but
very gravely. When she comes out to take her money her chap was
goue; 010 follows him, making more noise than haste after him. He,
taking no notice, goes on; at 10010 great many getting together at the
woman's outcry, he stands still, pleads his cause in the midst of the
multitude: there was very good sport; he denies that he bought any
figs 01 her, but that she gave them him frcely3 if she had a mind 10
1010 0 11101 101 11, 10 would put 10 an appearance.

Ge. Well, Ι will tell you a story not much unlike yours, 001
perhaps not much inferior 10 11, ssving it has not so celebrated an
author as Maccus. Pythagoras divided the market 1010 three sorts 01
persons-those that went thither 1ο 0011, those that went thither to buy 3
both these 00110 1010 0 0010101 0011 01 people, and therefore unhappy :
others came to see what was there 10 10 sold, and what was done;
these only were the happy people‚ because being free from care, they
took their pleasure freely. And this, he said, was the manner that a
philosopher conversed 10 1110 world, 00 they do in a market. But
there is 0 fourth kind of persons that walk about in our markets, who
neither buy nor sell, narare idle spectators 01 what others do, but lie
upon the catch to steal 111101111ογ 00ος andei this last 0011 there
are some that 010 wonderful dexterous. You would swear they were
born under a lucky planet. 001 00101101001 gave us a tale with sn
epilogus ; I will give you one with a prologus 1011. Now you shall
hear what happened lately at Antwerp.

An old priest had received there a pretty handsome sum of money,

but it was in silver. A sbarper has his eye upon him 3 he goes 10110
