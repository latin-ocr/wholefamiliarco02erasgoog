and about that sort 01 foed which the water produces and that which

· the land producesl An'd 11 1110 evil had reached but a few, it might

have been slighted. But' now we see the whole world in a flame on
account of these deadly contentione. These and such like things, were
they removed, we should both lire in greater concord, not mindiug
ceremonies, but pressing after those things which Christ hath taught
us, and the natione 01 110 world would the more readily embrace
religion were it accompanied with liberty.

Ι 0001000 it. Fi. Whosoever does not own the authority 01 110 pope
is ont 01110 pale 01110 church. Bu. I don’t deny that neither. Fi.
But he that neglecte his injunctions does not own him. Bu. ButI
hope a time will come that the pope, who is Clement by name, and
most of all so by nature, will mitigate all these things which hitherto
seem 10 bave alienated some people from the Roman Church 3 that he
may bring all 0011000 10 110 communion of it, and will rather pursue
those things that are for 110 good 01 110 church than his own private
interest. Ihear daily complaints 01 yearly offerings, perdone, dispen-
satione, and other exactione and church grievances3 but I believe he
will so moderate all things, 1101 10 time 10 come it would be impudent
10 complain. Fi. I wish all monarche would do the like, and 1100 Ι
would 00110011101Ο1010110011γ,011011000000011001 1ο 0 narrow

that they were called, 001 10 human servitude, but 10 gospcl liberty,
and that they were not sought alterio 10 made a prey 01, butte 0
sellow-enjoyrnent 01 happiness and holiness Ι1 0000 they came to be
united with us, and found in us manners truly Christian, they would
01 their own accord offer us more than 110 ntmost violence can extort
from them. ·
Bu. I should scon hope to see that accomplished‚ 11 1101 mischiev-
ous Ate, that 100 engaged the two most mighty monarche 10 110 world
in 0 bloody war, were 000110 her place (1.0. 10 110 dogs). Fi. I won-
der that that is not done already, when nothing 000 10 imagined more
humane than Francis, and Ι look upon it 1101 Charles has had princi·
ples instilled into him by his masters, that by how much the more
fortune enlarges the bounds 01 his empne, by so much the more he
increases in clemency and bounty, besides that, good humour and
lenity are peculiar to his ege. Bu. Yon will not find that they will be
wanting in anything.

Fi. What, then, is it that hinders the accomplishment 011101 which
all the world wishes forl Bu. Why, the lawyers have not yet come
10 00 agreement about bounds and limits, and you know that the storm
01 0 comedy always ends in the calm 010 matrimony; and the tragedies
01 princes commonly end 10110 like manner. But in comedies matches
are quickly made up, but among great men matters move but slowly 3

break 001 again in an ulcer. ·

Fi. But do you think marriages 10 10 firm bonde 01 amityl Bu.

I would have them 00, indeed; but Ι 000 sometimes 110 sharpest con-
