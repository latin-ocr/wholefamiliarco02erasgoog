death, if it be very much for· the good of the public 3 as the Greeks,
after the taking of Troy, put Astyanax, the son of Hector, to death, lest
he should seta new war on foot ι nor do they think it any wickedness
ιο put a tyrant’s innocent children to death after they have elain the
father. And do not we Christiane go to war, though at the sometime
the greatest share of the calamities falls on those persons that least
deservo theml He that does the injury is saved, and the greatest part
of the calamities falls upon those persons that least deserve them. And
it is the saure thing in our reprisals or letters of marqrre ; he who did the
wrong is safe, arrd the merchant is robbed‚ who never so much as h'eard
one word of it, he is so farfrorn being chargeable with the fault. Now,
if we make use of suelr remedies as these in things of no great moment,
what think you ought to be done in a matter of the greatest conse·
quencel Pe I am overcome hythe truth of your arguments.

Ga. Then take this along with you too. As soon as ever· the
pingue begins ιο appear in Italy, the infooted honses are shut up, and
the nurses that look efter the sick are forbidden to appear abroad.
And though some e'all this inhumanity, it is tlre greatest humanity;
for by this prudent care the calamity is put a stop to by the burials
of ο· few persons. But how great humanity is it to take care to preserve
‘the lives of so many tlrousandsl Some think it a very inhospitable
thing for the Italians, when there is but the bare report of a pestilenoe‚
to drive travellers from their very gates in an evening‚ and force them
to lie all night in the open air. But for my part, Ι account it arr aot of
piety to take care of the public good at the inconvenience of a few.
Some persons look upon themselves very courageous and complaisant
in daring to venture to visit one that is sick of the plague, having no
manner of eall at all to do it 5 but what greater folly can there bethan
by this courage, when they oome horne, to bring the distemper to their
wives arrd children, and all their family‘l What can ιο mors unkind
than by this complaisance ιο a friend, to bring those persons that are
the dearest ιο you intbe world into the danger of their livesl But
then again, how less dangerous is the plagae itself than tlre poxl The
plaguo frequently passas by those that are nearest, and seldom affecte
theold, and ss to those that it does effect, it either (lespatclres thern
quickly or restores them to their health nrueb sounder than they were
before. But as for the pox, what is that but a lingering death, or, to
speok more properly, burialf

Pe. What you say is very true, and at least the same care ought
to be taken to prevent so fatal en evil as they take ιο prevent the
spreading of tho leprosy ; or if this should be thought too much, nobody
should let another 'shave him, but be lris own barber. Ga. But what
will you say if both of them keep their months shutl Pe. They would
take the infection irr at their nostrils. Ga. But there is a remedy for
that too. Pe. What is itl Ga. They may do as the alchemists do,
they may wear a mask with glasses for eyes to see through, and a
breathing place for their· mouths and nostrils through a horn which
reaches from their jawbones down ιο their back Pe. That contriv-
ance might do pretty well if there were no danger from the touch of the
finger, the linen, the comba, and the scissors. Gn But, however,I
think it is tlre best way to let the beard grow, though it be even down
ιο the knees. Pe. Why, ramos that mind too. And then let there
