ethome. Nasica peroeived how matters went, and departed. Aster-
wards Ennius, in his turn, entering the house of Nasica, aske the boy
whether his master vsa within or not Nasica ories alond from an
inner room, saying,I am not at home. Ennius, knowing his voioe,
ories, Art thou notan impudent fellowi Dost think I don‘t know
thee when thou speakesti Rather you, says Nasica, are the more
impudent, who won’t give credit to mo myseli when I believed your
servant.

Na. Perhaps you were very busy. Pa. No, in troth, Ι was most
pleasantly at leisura Na Agajn you perplex me with riddles. Pb.
Why, then, Ι will speah plainly, and not oall anything out oi its name
Na Say on. Pa. In short, I was fast asleep. Ne. What sayest
thoul what, at past eight, when the sun risee' this month before iourl
Pa The sun is very weloome to rise at midnight ior me; truly 1 love
to sleep my bellyful. Ne. But was this by aooident, or is it your
eommon oustomi Pt. Why, truly,I am pretty muoh used to it.
Ne. But the habit of evil is most pernicious. Pa Thereis no sleep
so pleasant as efter sunrising.

Ne. Prithee, at what hour do you use to leave your bedl Pla
Why, some time betwixt four and nine. Na A very pretty spaoe oi
time, truly3 awoman oi quality ie soaroe so long a dressing. But how
came you into this agreeable methodi Pa Because we used to spond
most part of the night in good eating and drinking, play, merriment,
and what not, end this expense we repay by a good sound eleep in the

meantime I neither burn my oandles nor wear out my clothes. Ne.
Ridiculous parsimony, to destroy jewels that thou mayest preserve

Pa. ls that destroyed which is given to the bodyt Ne. It is rather
taking away from the body, which is then best affeoted, most lusty and
strong, when it is resreshed by timely and moderate eleep, and eorro·
borated by early rising.

Pa. But it is a pure pleasant thing to sleep. Ne. What ean bo
pleasant to him who has no sense oi anythingi Pb. Why, that alone

· most happy who eleep in their graves, ior they are never distrubed
with troublesome dreama Pt. They say the body is fed very much
by sleep. Ne. This is the food oi dormioe and not of men. The
beasts who are made only to eat are orammed very fitly, but how does
it relate to man to heap up fat, unless that he may tradge on under
