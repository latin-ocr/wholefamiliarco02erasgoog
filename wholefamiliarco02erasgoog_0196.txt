THE FRANOISOANS, OB, RICH BEGGARS. 189

Why do we eatl lardo. That we may not be starved with hunger.
Gon. And for the very same reason we take a garment that we may
not he starved with cold. Ioula Ι confess it. Cora This garment
of minois better for that than yours. It covers the head, neck, and
shoulders, from whence there is the most danger. Uae requires various
sorts of garments. A short ooat for a homeman, a long one for one·
that sits still, a thin one in summer, a thick one in winter. There are
some at Romo that change their clothes three times a day: in the

not furnished with this variety; therefore this germont of ours is con·
trived so that this one will serve for various uses. [ank. How is
thatl Coa. If the north wind blow, or the sun shines hot, we put on
oureow13 if the heat is troublesome we let it down behind. If we are
to sit still, we let down our garment about our heels 3 if we are to walk,
we hold or tuck it up. Ioula He was no fool, whosoever he was, that
contrived it. Coa. And itis the chief thing in living happily for a
man to accustom himself to be content with a few things. Foris once
we begin to indulge ourselve's with delicacies and sensualities there
will be no end 5 and thereis no one germont oould be invented that
could answor so many purposes. [auk. Ι allow that

Coa. Now let us consider the decency of it. Pray‚ tell me honestly
if you should put on your wife's clothes, would not every one say that
you acted indecentlyf laad. They would say I was mad. Gon.
And what would you say if she should put on your clothesl Iaak. I
should not say much, perhaps, but 1 should cudgel her handsomely.
Coa. But then, how does it signify nothing what garment any one
wearsl Iank. Oh, yes, in this case it is very material. Cora Nor
isthat strange ; for the laws of the very pagana inflict a punishment
on either man or woman that shall wear the clothes ofa different sex.
[ank. And they are in the right for it. Con. But, corne on What
isan old man of fourscore should dress himself like a boy of fifteen, or
if a young man dress himself like an old man, would not every one say
he ought to be banged for itl Or if an old woman should attire herself
like a young girl, and the eontraryl Inak. N o doubt Gora In like
manner, if a layman should wear a priest’s habit, and a priest a layman's.
Iuak. They would both act unhecomingly. Gora What if a private
man should put on the habit of a prince, or au inferior clergyman that
oi a bishopl Would he act unhandsomely or nol quk. Certainly
he would. Coa. What if a citizen should dress himself like a soldier,
with a feather in his cap, and other acooutrements of a hectoring
soldierl Innk. He would be laughed at. Coo. What if an English
ensign should carry a white cross in his colours, a Swiss a red one, a
Frenchman a black onef June. He would act imprudently.

Coa. Why then do you wonder so much at our habitl [ank. I
know the difference between a private man and a prince, betweena
man and a woman3 bnt Ι do not understand the difference between a ·
monk and no monia Coa. What difference is there between a poor
man and a rich manl Ioula Fortuna Con. And yet it would be
unhecoming a poor man to imitate a rich man in his dressf Iaulc
Very true, as rich men go now adays Gora What difference is there
· between a fooland awise mani Ioula Something morethan thereis
