132 FAMILIAR coracem&

Xa. Well, what happened alter thati

En. The young lady, going away after her father’s discourse was
ended, went direetly into her chambot, and finding her husband alone,
she fell down on her knees and said, Husband, till this very moment
1 neither knew you nor myself; but from this time forward yon shall
lind me another soit of person, only Ι entreat you to sorget what is
past The husband received this speech with a hias, and promised to
do everything she could desire, if she did bnt continue in that resolu-
tion. Xa. Whatl did she continue in itt En. Even to her dying
day, nor was anything so mean but she readily end cheerfully went
about it, if her husband would have it so. So great a love grew, and
was confirmed between them. Some years aiter the young lady would
often congratulata herself that she had happened to marry such a
husband, which,'had it not happened, said she, I had been the most
wretched woman alive.

X a. Such husbands are as scaros now-adays as white crows.

Eu. Now, if it will not be tedious to yon, Ι will tell you a story
. that lately happened in this city, of a husband that was reclaimed by
the good management of his wife. Xa. 1 have nothing to do at
present, and your conversation is very diverting.

Eu. There is a certain gentleman of no mean descent3 he, like the
rest of his quality, used often to go a hunting ; being in the country,
he happened to see a young damsel, the daughter oi a poor old woman,
and began to fall desperately in love with her. He was a man pretty
well in years, and for the salse of this young maid he often lay ont at
nights, and his pretence ior it was hunting. His wife, a woman of an
admirable temper, suspecting something more than ordinary, went in
search to lind out her husband’s intrigues, and having discovered them,
byI cannot tell what method, she goes to the country cottage aud
learnt all the particulare where he lay, what he drank, and what
manner of entertainment he had at table. There was no sumiture in
the house, nothing but nalrad walls. The gentlawoman goes home, aud
quiclrly aster goes back again, carrying with her a handsome bed and
sumiture, some plate and money, hidding them to treat him with more
respect if at any time he came there again.

A few days after her husband steals an opportunity to go thither,
and sees the furniture increased, and finds his entertainment more
delicate thenit used to be ; he inquired from whence this unaccus-
tomed finery came 'I'hey said that a certain honest gentlewoman of his
acquaintance brought these things, and gave them in charge, that he
should be treated with more respect for the future. He preseutly sns-
peete'd that this was done by his wife. When he came home, he asked
her if she had been there. She did not deny it. Then he ashed her
sor what reason she had sent thither that household furniturel My
dear, says she, you are used to a handsomer way of living; Ifound that
you iared hardly there, 1 thought it my duty, since you took a fancy
to the place, that yonr receptieu should be more agreeable.

Xa. A wile good even to an excess. I should sooner have sent
· him a bundle of nettles and thorns than furnished him with a fine bed.

Era But hear the conclusion of my story; the gentleman was so
touched, sesing so much good nature and tempor in his wife, that he

never aiter that violated her bed, but solaced himself with her at home.
