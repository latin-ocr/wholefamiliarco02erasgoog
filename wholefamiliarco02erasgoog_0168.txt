THE nonrmlli BANQUEY. 161

Ι will write down Porphyry’s worda, is we can believe them to be his:
She is emilia says he, under that form, as though she were become
deformed by travel 3 by slendemess of body he means a natural lean-
nesa A shameful mistake, if so great a man did· not pereeive that the
law of the metre did contradict the sense. Nor does the fourth place
admit of e spondae. But the poet makes a jest ol it. That she did
indeed bear a child, though she was not long weak, nor kept her bed
long aster her delivery, but presently jumped out of bed, aa some lusty
lying-in women used to do. Ili. We thank you, Sbrulius, for giving
us such fine sance to our eggs.

La. There is another thing in the first book of Odes that is not
much unlike this. The ode begins thus, Tu aa qeiaesiemb. Now, the
common reading is this, Neu Babylonios uetare cumaea, at caeliae

quiequid crit pati. The ancient interpretem pass this place over, as if ¹

there were no difficulty in it. Only Mancinellus, thinking the sen·
tence imperfect, bids us add poeria st. Have you anything more
that is certain about this matter l te. I do not know whether I have
or not ; but, in my opinion, Horace seems here tc have made use of
the Greek idiom, and this he does more than any other of the poeta.
For it is a very common thing with the Greeks to jein an infinitiva

mood with the word ὡς and ὡσι. And so Horace uses at pati for ut
petraria· although what Mancinellus guasses is not altogether absurd.
Hi. Ilike what you say very well. Run, Mouse, and bring what is
to come, if there be anything. ‘

Or. What new dainty dish is thisl Hi. This is a cucumber
sliced. This is the brotb of the pulp of a gourd boiled ; it is good to
make the belly loose. sb. We will change thy name, and call thee
Apicius instead os Hilary. lli. Well, laugh now as much as you
vill, it may bc you will highly commend this supper tomorrow. St.
Why sol Hi. When you find that your dinner has been well
seasoned. St. What, with a good stomachi Hi. Yes, indeed.

Or. Hilary, do you know what task 1 would have you take upon
youl Hi. I shall know when you have told me. Or. The choir
cinga some hymna that are indeed learned ones, hut are corrupted in
many places by unleerued persons. I desire that you would mend
them ; and to give you an example, we sing thus-

Hostis, Herodes, impie,
Christum venire quid timeat

Oh “ffhou wicked enemy, Herod, why dost thou dread the coming os
ris

The misplacing oi one word spoils the verse two ways. For the word
hostia making a trochaeum no place in an iamhic verse, and Hero,
being a spondee, will not stand in the second place. N or is there any
doubt but the verse at first was thus written-

Herodes hostis impie.

For the epithet impie better agrees with toste than with Herod.
Beaides, Herodes being a Greek word η is turned into ε in the vocative3
aa, Σωκρὰτης, ὤ Σώκρατες ; and so Ἀγαμέμνων in the nominative
case is turned into o. So again we sing the hymn-
