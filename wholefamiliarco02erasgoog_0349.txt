342 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

01 age. I think also that it ought to be resolved, nemine contradicente,
that no woman be allowed particularly to mention her own husband by
name too ireely. It may be allowed to spcak in the general, but that
too ought to 110 done with moderation and decency. Oa. But why
may it not be allowed us to talk freely 01 the men here, when they are
always talking about us everywherel My Titius, whenever 110 has a
mind to diveat his company, tells them what he did with me in the

01 the men 3 so that 11 we exposa them, what else do we do but disgrace
ourselvesl And although, indeed, we have a great many just com-
plaints against them, yet 'all things being duly considered, our condition
is much preferable to theirs. For they, endeavouriug to get a main-
tenance 101111011 semilies, scamper through all the parts of 1110 earth
by land and sea In times 01 war they are called up by the sonnd 01
the trumpet, stand in armour in the 110111 01 the battle, while we sit at
home in sasety. 11 they transgressa the law, they are punished severely 3
but our sexis spared. And in the last place, 1011110 most part it is in
our own power to make our husbands such as we would have thern.

But it remains that we come to some resolutione about precedency
ln taking places, lest it should be with us as it often happens among
the plenipotentiaries of kings, princes, and popes‚ who, in their eon-
gresses, squabble away three months at least in punctilios and cere-
mony before they can sit down 10 business. Therefore it is my opinion
that none but peeresses sit in the first bench; and these shall take
their places according to the degrees of their nobility. hirst, those that
have 10111 ; next, those that have three3 after them, those that have
two; then those who have one 3 and last of all, those who have but
helfa one. And in every rank regard 'shall be had to antiquity.
Bastards 01 every rank shall sit in the lowest place 01 it. The next
bench shall be that 01 the commons3 and 01 those, they shall sitin 1110
ioremost places who harahad the most children 3 and between those
who have liud the same number, ago shall decide the difference. The
third bench shall be for those who never had any children.

Oa. Where do you intend to place 1110 widowsl Co. Well
rememhered. They shall have their scats in the middle of the mothers,
if they bavo children, 010101 had any3 those that have been barren

design 101· the wives of priests and monksl Co. We will consider 01
that matter at our next mcetiug. du. What do you determine about
those women who get their living by their bodily labourl Co. We
will not sufl'er this assembly to 110 polluted by the mixture 01 such
cattle. Ja. What will you do concerning kept mistressesl Co.
They are 01 several ranke 3 we will consider that when we are more at
lcisure. There is another matter 10 be considered os, how 110 shall
give our votes—whether by scratcbing or balloting, or by word of
tricks mouth, or holding up our hands, or by dividing. Ga. There are
in balloting, and so there are in scratching 3 and 11 we give our
vote by dividing, as we wear long petticoats, we shall raise 100 much
dust 3 so that l am 01 opinion, it will be the best way 101 every one to give
her vote vica voce. Co. But it will be a difficolt matter to number the
votes And then too, great care ought to be taken thet it be 1101
