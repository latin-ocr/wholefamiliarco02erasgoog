358 · FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

speak significantly than elegantly; for he is said to be modest that
thinks moderately of himself, arrogating nothing to himself more than

he deserves. But the commendation of ταπεινοφροσύνῃ (humility)
belongs only to him that ascribes less to himself than he hath.

Le. But then there is danger, while we affect to be modest we
happen to be vain. Ha How sol Le. Why,is Paul spoke truth in
liiindffll”ilmlllhhlilihlliiinalpo‘lilllhffmlilildllllhy
stances, then they ru'n the hazaid of lying who set them out in so
magnificent titles. Hi. My good friend, here is no great danger in that,
for when¹ we set out good men or women with praises, in that we speak
forth the goodness of God to them3 hut when they debase themselves
they have an eye to what their own strength and merits are, if it were
not for the grace of God. Nor is it of necessity a lio if any one does
not lay claim to what he has, if he speaks as he thinks it can at most
be but a mistake3 it cannot be called a do'wnright lie, and God is
'pleased when we are in this error.

Le. Paul, who 'denies that he was worthy to be called an apostle,
i'n another place speaks very magnificently of himself, recounting his
performances: “I have‚'' saith he, ‘⁴ laboured more than all, and those
who seem to be something have added nothing to me.” Whereas we
do not read the holy Virgin said anything of this nature. Hi. But
Paul calls these performances his infirmities by which the power of
God was manifested, and likewise calls the mention of them folly, to
which he was compelled by the wickedness of some salse apostles‚ who
had rendered it necessary for him ιο lay claim to his· apostolica}
authority; not that he delightcd in human glory, but because it was
expedientius the gospel, the dispensation of which was committed ιο
him. The Virgin had not the same reason, she had not the office of
preaching the gospel committed to her. Resides, the utmost deceney
and modesty became her as a woman, as a virgin, and as the mother

, oi J esus.

Now Icome to the original of this err'or. They that do not under·
stand Latin think humility signifies nothing but a notable modesty‚
when it is often made use ol as to place or condition, and not as ιο·
any virtue of the mind 3 and sometimes it is so applied to the mind as
ιο signify that which is blameworthy. Le. What, in the holy scrip·
turesl Hi. Yes; here is a place for you in the Epistle of Paul to ιιο
Colossians, chap. ii ver. 18,-—“Let no man seduce you in a voluno
tary humility and worshipping of angels” Nor is it in this place

ἐν ταπεινώσει, which is tha word that isin the Virgin’s song, but

ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ. The place,I confess, has something of difficulty
in it, but I take that to be the genuine sense of it that learned meu
have accurately given it: Be ye not of so low and abject a mind, as,
having once dedicated yourselves ιο Christ, the only author of salvation‚
to suffer yourselves to hope for salvation from angela, whom some pretend
to have appeared ιο them. Be ye of so high a mind as that if any
angel, who really came from heaven, should preach any other gospel
than that which Christ hath delivered, let him be accursed as a wicked
angel and an enemy to Christ. Much less is it fit that you should bs
of such abject minda as to suffer yourselvcs to be led away from Christ
by their seigned apparitione. Το hope for salvation from Christ alone
