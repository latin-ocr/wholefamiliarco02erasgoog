by modesty, led on by hope, or deterred by sear, for they know the
danger οἱ meddling with men of power. And last of all, when you are
got over head and ears in debt, then upon one pretence or another l
remove your quarters first to one place and theuto another; and you ζ p
need not be ashamed of that, for nohody is more in debt than great 3
princes. If you find yourself presscd by a fellow of mean condition, ι
make as if you were provoked by his confideuee3 but make a small ’
payment now and then, but never pay the whole sum, nerto all your
creditors. But you must always take care that none ever come to,
know that yon have an empty pocket ; always make a show of money. ζ
Ila. But what can a man make a show ol that has nothingl Ne. If'
any sriend has given you anything to lay up for him, shew it as your Ι
own, hut do it artfully, as if it were done by chance. And it will be .
good in this case to borrcw money and shew it, though you pay it again
presently. Pull a couple of guineas, that you have placed by them-
selves, out of your pocket, from a whole pocketsul of counters. You
may imagiue— Ha. I understand you ; but at last I must of
necessity sink under my debts

Ne. Yon know what knights can do with us. Ha. They do just
what they plesse, and there is no redisse. Ne. Let those servants
you keep bo such as are diligent enee, or some of your kindred, such as
must be kept however. They will stumble now and then upon some
merchant upon the way and rob him3 they will find something in an
iun, a house, or a boat that wants a keepcr; they will remember that
a man’s fingers were not given him for nothing. Ha. Ay, if this ·’
could be douo with sascty. Ne. You must take care to keep them in
handsome liveries, and be still sending them with counterfeit letters
to this great man or the other. lf they steal anything, although
they should suspect them, nobody will dare to charge them with it, scr
sear os tho knight their master. ls they chance to take a booty by
force, it is as good as a prize in war. Ha. Oh, bravo counsel! Ne.
This araxim of knighthood is always to be maintained, that it is lawl'ul
for a knight upon the road to ease a common traveller of his money,
sor what can be more dishonourable than sor a pitisul tradesman to
have money enough, and a knight at the sume time wants it tc spend
upon his whores and at ‹lieel Get as much as you ean into the com-
pany of great men, though you pin yourself upon them; and that you Ι
may not be aslramed of anything‚ you must put on a hrazen sace, but)¹
especially to your host. And it will be best for you to live in some y?
public place, as at tho Beth, and at the most frequented inns. Ila. I ᾖ,
was thinking ot' that.

Ne. In such places fortune will oftentimes throw some prey in the
way. Ila. How,I beseeeh youl Ne. Suppose one draps a purse,
another leaves the key in the door of his storehouse, or sc, you take
me in. lla. But-— Ne. What are you afraid of l Who will dare
to suspect a person that goes as you dc, talks great, tho Knight of the
Golden Rockl If there shall happen to be any saucy fellow impudent
enough to dare to suspect you, the suspicion will rather be cast upon
somebody that went away the day before. There will be a disorder
arrrong the master and the servants, and do you hehave yourself as a
person wholly unconcerued. If this accident befals either a man of
moelesty or ct hrains, he will pessit over without making words of it,
