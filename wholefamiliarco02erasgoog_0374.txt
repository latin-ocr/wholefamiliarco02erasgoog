THE LOVER 01² GLORY. 367

also as to those things that are good, there is a certain secret instinct
of nature in ue, that we have an aversion for some things without any
apparent carrae, and are carried on witha wonderful propensity to
others Hence it is that one ie an expert soldier, another a good
politician‚ and another you would say was born to be a student. And
in these things too there isan admirable variety ae grem as ie the

diversity of employmente. Nature hae immed one for a general,
another for a good common soldier3 and where nature has been most
beautiful, there the seme person may be fit to command or obey, ae
⁴ Homer says. So likewise in civil affairs, one ie a good counsellor,
another a good barrister, another is made for an ambaesador, and
performs that office with great success. What need is there to mention
the variety of inclinatione? There are some who are so strongly
inclined to a monastic life, and yet not every one neither, but to this
or that particular order, that they take no pleasure of their lives if
they do not attain it 3 when, on the other hand, others have so strong
an aversion for that sort of life, that they had rather die than be made
monlrs. Neris this because they hate that way of living, or can give
any reason for it but by some seoret instinct in nature. Ph. As you
say, Ihave often found many such instances, and bave admired at theru.

Sy. In these gista that nature liberally bestows upon us, a person
shall be much lese liahle to envy, if a man be not proud and osten-
tatione. Beauty‚ nobility, wealth, eloquence appear the most lovely
in those persone that seem not to know they are endowed‘ with them.
Courtesy and modesty do no way lessen these advantagee 3 but as they
add a grace to them, so they drive away envy. And this courtesy and
sweetness of temper ought to go along with all the actions of our lives,
unless it be contrary to our nature; for in my opinion, Xenocrates
would bave attempted in vain that which Socrates end Diogenes
succeeded in3 Cato the Censor would in vain have endeavoured after
that which gained Laelius so much good will. Yet Demea in Terence
being altered so on a sudden, ie a sufficient instance of what efficacy it
isin gaining good will to suit ourselves with persons' inclinatione and
humours 3 but as often ae men deviato from right, they degenerata
from true glory to the temporary favour of man 3 but that glory only
is laeting which ie founded upon honesty, and comes from the judg-
ment of reason. For the affectione make their temporary efforts, and
when they have once spent themselves, we begin to hate what before we ¹
lored vehemently, end hies what before we clspped, and condemn what
before we commended. But though the disposition cannot be wholly
altered, yet it may in part be corrected. Ph. I want to hear what

ou aim at.
y Sy. He thetis of a complaisant temper ought to be carefullest,
while he labours tc ingratiate himself with all persons, he deviatee from
honesty 3 and lest, while he endeavours to accommodate himself to all

whose vanity one cannot forbear blushing. Sy. But then, again, they
who are cf a rugged temper ought to endeavour so to effect courteey
as that what they do may not seem to be counterfeit3 or by ever and
anon falling into their natural propensity, instead of commendation get
a double diegrm, first for acting rigidly, andthen for being inconsistent
