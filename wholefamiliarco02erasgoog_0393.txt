Pl. Why, pray is not the sense 01 touching common to the whole
bodyl Ta But in ease any such thing should fall out, they do not
offioiate after it till they have been 01 confession. Pa. It is eon·
scientiously done.

Th. But, without cavilling, Ι will tell you how it ia Meney ever
was and ever will he the occasion of very great evils to many persona
Pla I allow it ; but then, on the other hand, it is an instrument 01· as
much good to others. I find the inordinate love of money to be con-
demned, but Ι nowhere find money itself to be οο. 111. You say very
well ; but that we may 10 kept 01 greater distance from the discsse 01
covetousness, we are forbid to touch money as we 010 forbid by the
gospel 10 swear at all, that we may be kept from perjury. Pa. Why,

heard is 110 fiction ; 1011 was told once by a Polander, and a man 01
