force, what does the Lord mean in Deuteronomy, who uses so severe
a commination‚ that none add to or diminish from the lawl Fi. He
does not add to the law tbat more largely explains what lay couched in
it, and who suggests those things that have relation to the observation
of the law, nor does he diminish who preaches the law according to
the capacity of the hearers, declaring some things, and concealing
others, according tc the circumstances of the time.

Be. Were the constitutions of the Pharisees and Scribas
obligatoryl Fi. I do not think they ware. Bu. Why sol Fi.
Because, though they had authority ιο teach, yet not to make laws.
Bu. Which power is the greater, that of making human lawe or that
of interpreting divinet Fi. That of making human lawa. Bu. I
am os another mind 5 for he that bas the right of interpreting his
opinion has the soree of a divine law. Fi. Ι do not well take you in.
Bu. Iwill explain it to you. The divine law commanda us tc assist
our parents. Tha Pharisee interprete it thus: That which is offered
to the ehurch is given ιο the Father, because God is the father of all.
Does not the divine law then give place ιο this interpretationi Fi.
But that is a salsa interpretation. Bu. But when once they have
received an authority os interpreting, how can I tell which interpreta-
tion is true, and especially if they differ among themselvesl Fi. If
you cannot be satisficd as to the sense of the commenalty, follow the
authority of the prelatas ; that is the sascst.

Bu. Is then the authority of the Scribas and Pharisees devolvad
upon divinas and preachersl Fi. Ιι is. Bu. I haar none more
ready to inculcata, ‘⁴ hear, I say unta y0u,” than those that never made
divinity much their study. Fi. You must hear all candidly, but
with judgment, unless they ara quite mad. Then people ought to risa
and hiss them out of the pulpit, to make them sensible of their mad·

· nese. But you ought ιο believe those that have arrived to the degree

of a doctor in divinity. Bra But among tham I find a great many
that are much more ignorant and foolish than those that are altogether
illiterata3 and I sae much controversy among the learned themselves.
Fi. Single out tha best things, and leave those things that are difficult
to others, always receiving those things that the consent of the rulers
and majority has approved. Bu. I know that is the safest way.
But then there are salsa constitutions as well as false interpretatione.
Fi. Whether there ba or no, let others look to that. I believe there
ma be.

yBu. Had Annas and Oaiaphas authority tc make lawsl Fi.
Yes, they hadl Bu. Did these men's constitutions in all things
obliga to the punishment of helll Fi. Icannot tell. Bu. Suppose
Annas had made an order that nobody coming from a market should
touch a bit of meat before he had washed his body: if any one ate
meat unwashed, did he incur the pain of damnationi Fi. Ithink
not, unless the contempt of the public authority aggravated tha crima.
Bu. Did all the lawa of God obligo to the punishment of eternal
damnationi Fi. Ι believe n0t; for God forbids all sin, how venial
soerar, if we may believe divinas. Bu. But perhaps a venial sin
might send to hell, unless God by His mercy assisted our infirmity. ,
Fi. lt is no absurdity to say so, but l dare not affirm it. Ba. When
