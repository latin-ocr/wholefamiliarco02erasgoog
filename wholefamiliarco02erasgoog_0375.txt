with themselves For coustancy has so great an efficacy that they who
are naturally of a bad temper are the easier horne with for this reason,
because they always act like themselves 5 ior as soon as the disguise in·
seen through, even things that have been well acted become displeasing.
And besides, that which is done under a colour cannot be kept always
concealed3 it will come out one time or other, and whenever it does,
all the gay appearance drops off and becomes amere jest.

Pa. If Ι take in your intention, you would have one depart u
little as may he from nature, but not at all from iutegrity (that which
is honestis honourahlet Sy. You are right; and besides, you know
very well that whatsoever grows famous on a sudden lies exposed to

ι envy. And thence comes the odious name os an upstart, called by the

Greeks νεοπλούτος ; and hythe Romanarum tomo;·and by both
urroefilii [sons oi the earth] and coelo delapsi [dropped out of the clouds}
But that reputation that springs up gently, and grows gradually, as on
the one side it is less liable to envy, so on the other it is commonly more
durahle ; as the witty poet Horace intimatas, saying, Orescr‘t oceako velut
orbor evofomu Marcelli (Marcellus’s fame grows insensibly like a tree).
So that if you would obtain glory that is true, tasting, and as little aa
may be obnoxious to envy, mind what Socrates says, that it often
happens that they who make the most haste at first setting out come
latest to their journey’s end.

Pl. But the life ol man is very short. Sy. For that reason we
should use expedition towards good deeds, and not glory3 and that will
follow necessarily ol its own accord. For Ι suppose what you inquire
alter is not how you may live long, for that is in the bressts of the
destinies, who draw out and cut off the throados life at their pleasure.
Ph. I wish you could do that too. Sy. O Philodoxusl God has
never been so hountiful as to give all to one man : what one wants in
years is often made up in honour. There are, indeed, some, but those
very few, to whom he is so bountiful that while they are alive aud aa
it were in being, they enjoy the sruits of posterity; though they are but
lew that the just God loves. Perhaps some os a divine descent have
attained this ; hut this felicity does not sall under our consideration.

Pl. I have often admired whether it is by the malignity of nature
or fortune, that no couveniencies huppen to mankind without being
alloyed with some inconvenienoe. Sy. My friend, what then have we
to do but, as we are of human race, to endeavour to bear our human
condition with a contentedmindl And it will notalittle conduco to
moderate envy, if you do but look thoroughly into the dispositione οἰ
nations, of bodies oi men, and single persons ; as they do who make it
their business to tame and feed beasts; for such persons make it their
chief study to find out by what things the animal is made fierce or
becomes tame. 1 do not at present speak of the differente between a
bird and a four-footed beust, between a serpent and a fish, or between
the eugle and the vulture, between the elephant and the horse, between
the delphin and the porpoise, between a viper and sn asp; but ol' the
innumerable variety that is between all kinds ol animala. Pa I
would fain hear what you drive at Sy. All dogs are contained under
one species, but this species is diversified into innumerable forms, ao
that you would say they were so many distinct genera, rather than
one species: for in the same species, what a grele variety is there ol
