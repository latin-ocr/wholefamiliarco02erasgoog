tell me do they nse to preach on Saturdaysl Hi. Yes, they do in
honour of the Virgin Mary; for Christ’s day is on Sunday, and it is

Hi. Heweut through the song of the Virgin Mary. Le. Thetis a
very common argument Hi. The litter for him that preached upon
it, for I believe he never learned any argument but this; as they say,
there are some priests who cau say no part of the common prayer but
the service for the dead. Le. Well, then, let him be called the
magnificat preacher, or, if you will, the magnificaturian. But what sort
of a fellow is hel what habit does he wcarl lli. He isawolf in

Le What house did he come out oft Hi. The Francisoans. Le.
How say you, a Franciscanl what, oue of that holy orderl It may be
he is one of those that are called Gaudentes, that wear garments of a
brown oolour, whole shoes, a white girulo, and make no scruple (I
tremble to speak it) to touch money with their bure fingere. Hi. N ay,
none of them, Ι will assure you, but of those that call themselves
Observants, that wear ash-coloured garmeuts, hempeu girdles, out and
slashed shoeS, and would rather commit murder than touch money
without gloves. Le. It is no strange thing for a ncttle to grow in a
rose-bed 3 but who brought this sool upon the stagel Hi, You would

Augsburg, iu the great chureh there, where there was so great a con·
course of sovereign princes, whom the Emperor Charles had drawn
together from all parts of Germany, Italy, Spain, and Euglandl And
besides, there were a great many menos learning present at the sermon,
especially of the courtiers. Le. I should wonder if such a swine should
produce auything worthy ot‘ such an auditory. Hi. Ι will assure you
he did produce a great many things worthy of himself. Le. What
were they, pritheel but first, pray tell me his name. Hi. That is
not convenient. Li. Why so, Hilaryl Ili. I do not love to gratify
such follows. Le. Prithee, hold thy tongue. Is that a gratisyiug οἰ
