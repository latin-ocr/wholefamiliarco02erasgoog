pronouncs 1101 unvoidable sentence, which will cest the devil ,together
with those 1101 have taken his part, 1010 0100001 punishment, that they
may not after that be able to do mischief 10 any. He will translate
the godly, being freed from 011 trouble, to a fellowship with Him in
His heavenly kingdom—although He would have the day 01 Η10
coming unknown to 011. Aa. I hear no error yet. Let us now
come to the third person Bo. As you plesse

· Aa. Dost thou believe in the Holy Spiritl Ba. Ι10 believe that
it is true God, together with the 101100 001 110 Son„ I believe they
1101 wrote us the books 01110 Old and New Testaments were inspired
by it, without whose help 00 man attaius salvation. Au. Why is he
called a 0010111 Ba. Because as our bodies do live by breath, 00 000
minds 000 quickened by the secret inspiration 01 110 Holy Spirit.

. Aa. Is it not lawful to csllthe 101100 0 0010111 Ba. Why 0011

Aa. Are not then the persons confoundedl Bu. No, not at 011, 100
110 101100 10 called a spirit, because He is without a body, which
thing is commento all the persons according 10 11010 divine nature3
but the third person is called a spirit, because he breathes 001 001
transfusos himself insensibly into 000 minds, even aa the air breathes
from the land or the rivers. Aa. Why is the name 01 Son given to
the second personl Bo. Because 01 Η10 0001001 likeness 01 001000
001 will. Aa. Is the Son more like the Father than the Holy Spiritl
Ba. Not according 10 110 divine nature, except that He resembles the
property 01 110 101100 110 more in this, that the spirit proceeds from
Himalso. Au. 111011ιο10ιο1100101110111οΗ010801011000010
called Son. Ba. Because, as St. Hilary saith, Inowhere read that
he was begotten‚ neither do I read 01 his fathei3 1 read of the Spirit,
001 1101 proceeding from

Aa. Why' rs the Father 01000 001101 (101 rn the 000011 Ba.
Because He, as I have said before, 10 simply the author of all things that
are, 001 110 1000101001 110 whole deity. Au. Speak in plainer terms.
Ba. Because nothing can be named which heth not its original from
the 101100. 100, indeed, in this very thing, that the Son and Holy
Spirit is God, they acknowledgc 1101 they received it from the Father;
therefore the chief authority, 11011010 ssy, the cause 01 beginning, is
in 110 101100 01000, because He 01000 10 01 none. But yet, in the
0000111 may 1000 taken, 1101 110 name 01 God may not be proper to
one person, but used in general, because it is distinguished afterwards
by the term 01 101100, son, sud Holy Spirit into one (101 3 which
word 01 nature comprehends the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, that is
to say, the three persons.

Au. Dost thou believe in the holy churchl Ba. No. Au.
What say youl Do you not believe in 111 Ba. Ibelievein the holy

tion 01011 men throughout the whole world, who agree in the faith 01
110 gospel, who worship one God the 101100, who put their whole
confidente rn his Son, who are guided by the same Spirit of Him,
from whose followship heis 001 off that commits 0 deadly sm. Aa.
But why 10 you stick to say, Ι believe' m the holy churchl Ba.
Because St. cyprian hath taught me, that we must believe in (lod
