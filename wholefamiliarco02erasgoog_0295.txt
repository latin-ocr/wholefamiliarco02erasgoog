Bu. But then, again, how preposterously do we judge concoming
perjuryl He is accounted an inlamous person who swears he has paid
a dcbt, when it is proved he has not. But perjury is not charged upon
apriest who publicly lives unchastely, though he publiely profess a
life oi chastity. Fi. Why do you not tell this to the bishop's vicere,
who swear before the altar that they have found all that they present
to be entered into holy orders to be fit persons in age, learning, and
manners; when for the most part there are scarce two or three that
are tolerable, and most of them scarce fit to follow the ploughl Bu.
He is punished, that being provoked swcars in a passion ; but they
that lorswear themselves every three words they speak escape scotfree.
Fi. But they do not swear from their hearts. Bu. By the same
colourable pretence you may vindicate a man that kills another, saying,
he did not do it in his heart. Perjury is not lawful either in jest or
earnest 3 and it would make the crime the greater to kill a man in jest

Fi. What if we should weigh the oaths princes take at their
coronation in the same scale l Bu. These things, though indeed they
are very serious matters, being done customarily, are not accounted
perjuries. There is the same complaint concerning vows. The vow of
matrimony is without doubt of divine right, yet it is dissolved by
entering into a monastic life of man’s invention. And though there is
no vow more religione than that of baptism, yet he that changes his
habit or hia place is sought after, apprehended, confined‚ and some-
times put to death for the honour of the order,as though he had
murdered his lather3 but those whose lives are diametrically repugnant
to their baptismal vows, in that they serve mammon, their bellica, and
the pompa of this world, are in mighty esteem, are never charged with
breaking their vow, nor upbraided, nor. called apostates, but are rechoned
ood Christiana.
g Bu. The common people have the like esteem of good and bad
deeds, and the safeguard of virtue. What a scandal is it for a maid to

mind are greater crimes3 and where is it that a small theft ianot
punished more severely than adulteryl Nobody will willingly keep
him company that hae been accuaed of thcft; but it is accounted a piace
of honour to hold a familiarity with such as are dranched in adultery.
Nobody will deign to marry a daughter to a hangman, who executes the

aversion at all to the affinity of a soldier, who has run away from his
parents, and listed himself¹ a soldier for hire, and is deliled with all the
rapeS, thefts, sacrileges, murders, and other crimes, that used to be
committed in their marchas, campe, and retreats3 this may be taken
for a son-in-law, and though he be worse than any hangman, a maid may
love him dearly, and account him a noble personage. He that stealsa
little money must be hanged3 but they that cheat the publicos their
money and impoverish thousands by monopolies, extortions, and triching
and cheating are held in great csteem. Fi. They that poison one
person are hanged for it; but they that poison a whole nation with
infectione provisione go uupunished.
