402 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

He. I call that evil that breaks the friendship between (1οὰ and man.
Sp. But Ι believe there are very few that 111 clear 111111 of this kind
He. And Ι take those that are cleansed to be pure; such ae by the
11111111 tears, end soap of repentence, und fite of oharity have washcd
away their pollutione. The sins of such persons are not only not
hurtful to them, but oltentlmes turn toa greater good. Sp. Iknow
what soap and suds rs3 but Ι never heard that pollutione were purged

away by fire. He 1111 you go to the refiner²s shop you will see
gold· purged by fire; and there' rs 1 certain sort of ilex which, being
put into the lires rs not burnt, but shines brighter, arrd 11 as clear 11
water, and therefore 11 called living fler„

Sp. In truth, thou bringeet us a paradox thetis more paradoxical
than all the paradoxae 11 the Stoica Do not they live a pleasant 1111
11 whom Christ has 111(1,“Β11111(1111111111111ιιιοιιιιι1”111111)7
seem to mourn to men oi the world, but rn reality they live deliciously,
and, as the old saying 11, being anointed with honey, live sweetly3 so
thui, compared to thern, Sardanapalus, Philoxenus, Apicius, or the
mosi noted voluptuary lived but 1 1111111111 1111. Sp. What you sayy
111111,1ιι111ι11111111111111111 He. Do but once make a trial, and
you will say over and over that what I say is true. I do not question
but Ι can make you sensible that it 11 111 incredible. Sp. Go about
it then. Hc. Iwill, 11 you will grant me something by way of pre
liminary. Sp. I will, is what you require 11 just. He. If you
ι grant them me Ι willreturn them with interest. Isuppose you will
allow that there 11 a difference between the soul and the bodyl Sp.
There rs so, and as much 11 between heaven and earth, immortal and
mortal. He. And again, that 11111 goede are notto be' taken for true
goodsl S. Nemore than the shadowe are to be taken for the
bodies themselves, or the delusione of magicians, or the fancies 11
dreams are to be accounted 111 111111.

He. So far you have answered me well· , Ι suppose you will likewise
grant me this, that there can be no real pleasure but in a sound mind.
Sp. Why noti A person cannot take pleasure in the eurr if his eyes are
sore, or relish wine in 1 11111. Η1. Nor 1111 Ι think Epicurus himself
would embrace a pleasure that has more pain init, and of longer oon·
11111111111111111111111111111111. Sp In my opinion, neither he nor
anybody else that has any sense would. He. Iwill presume you will
grant me this, that God himself rs the chiefest good, than which nothing
is more glorious, more lovely, and more pleasant. Sp. Nobody would
deny that but one 1111111 more brutish than a Cyclops. But what
thenl Ha. 117111,111111111111111111111111 me that nobodylives
more pleasantly than they that live piously, and nobody more miser-
ably and affliotedly than they that live wickedly. Sp. Then Ι granted
you more than I was aware of. He. But, as Plato says, that which
has been fairly granted ought not to be denied. Sp. Well, geom
He. A little puppy that 11 kept for pleasure 11 fed daintily, 1111 soltly,

plays and wantons continually3 does not she live pleasantly thenl
S. Yes. He. Would you wrsh for such a 1111111111 S. No ,by no
means, unless I should wish 1ο 11 1 dog.

He. Their you consess that true pleasures prooeed from the mind
as from a fountain. Sp. It 11 plain they do. He. So great 11 the

, 11111 oftlre mind that it often takes away the sense 11 outward pain,
