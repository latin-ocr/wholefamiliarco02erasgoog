THE PROFANE BANQUET. 81

to have the last place in the glory of learning. 2. The exemplos of

. amplification are mentioned before Now let us return to our own.

Nothing ever fell out to me more gratefully, acceptably, than thy letter.
Nothing ever was a greater pleasure than your letter. Ι never took
so much pleasure in anything as in thy most leving letters. “After
this manner all the before-mentioned sentences may be varied hyan
interrogation.” What in life could be more pleasant than thy lettersl
What has happened to me more sweet thau thy letterl What has
ever delighted me like your last letterl And after this manner you
may vary almost any sentence.

Ol. What shall we dc nowl Aa. We will now turn the whole
sentence a little more at large, that we may express one sentence by a
circumlocutiones many words. Cb. Give examples. Aa. “That
which was sometimes expressed hythe noun incredibile, and then again
by the adverb incredibiliter, we will change the sentence in some
words.” Ι cannot express how much I was delighted with your letters.

· It ia very hard for me to write, and you to believe how much pleasure

your letter wasto me. Ι arn wholly unable to express how I rejoiced
at your letter. “And so od testanteesa- again, aster another manner.
For hitherto we have varied the sentences by negatione and interro-
gatione, and in the last place by infinitives. Now we will vary by
substantivas or conditionale, after this manner.” Let me die if any-
thing ever was more desired and more pleasant than thy letters. Let
rue perish if anything ever was more desired and more pleasant than
thy letter. As God shall judge me, nothing in my whole life ever
happened more pleasant than thy lettera. “And also a great many
more you may contrive aster this manner.” Ol. What is to be done
uowl Au. Now we must proeeed to translation, similitudes, and
exam les.

innan 1s a Tanasnarrca ru iussn-I have received your letters,
which were sweet as honey. Your writings seem to be nothing but
urere delight. Your letters are a mere pleasure, and a great mauy of
the like kinds. “But care is tc be taken not to make use oi harder
translations, such as this that follows,-

Jupiter hybernas cani nive conspuit Alpes

such as this is.'’ The suppers os thy writinge have refrcshed me with
most delicious banquets.

A Cournmsoa av Simia-Thy writings· have been sweeter
than either ambrosia or nectar. Thy letters have been sweeter to
ure than any honey. Your kind letters have excelled even liquorish
locusta, and Attia honey, sugar; nay‚ even thc nectar and ambrosia of
the gods. “And here, whatsoever is ennobled with sweetness may be
brought into the comparison.’'

Facu Exanimis—I will never be induced to believe that Hero
received the letters of her Leander, either with greater pleasure or '
ruore kisses than Ι received yours. Ι can scarce believe that Scipio,
sor the overthrow of Carthage, or Paulus AEmilius, ior the taking cf
Perseus, ever triumpbed ruore magnificently than I did when the
postman gave me your most charming'letter. “There are a thousand
things os this nature that may bc found in poeta and historiens
Likewise similitudes are borrowed from natural philosophy, the nature
