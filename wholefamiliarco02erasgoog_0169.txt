“0 J esus, the crown of virgins,
Whom she, the mother, conceived, ,
Which was the only person ofa virgin that brought forth.”

Theseis no doubt but the word should be pronounced concipit ,· for
the change of the sense sets off a word, and it is ridiculous for us to
find fault with concipit when portarit follows. Hi. Truly I have been
puzzled at a great many such things; nor will it be omiss if. hereafter,
we bestow a little time upon this matter. For methinlrs Ambrose has
not a little grace in this kind of verse, for he does commonly end a
verse of four feet with a word of three syllables, and commonly places
a coesura in the end of a word. It is so common with him that it
cannot seem to have been by chance. If you would have an example,
Deae Creator. Here is a penthemimeris, it follows omniam- Poliquc
rector, then follows vestim· diem decore, and then leontina motem soporis,
then follows pratia. Hi. But here is a good fat hen that has laid me
eggs and hatched me chickens for ten years together. Cr. Itis pity
that she should have been killed.

Oa. lf it were fit to intermingle anything of graver studies‚l have
something to propose. Ili. Yes, if it be not ῖοο crsbhed. Ga. That
it is not. 1 lately began to read Seneca’s “ Epistles,” and stumbled, as
they say, at the very threshold. The place is in the first epistle.
And if, says he, thou wilt but observe it, great part of our life posses
away while we are doing what is ill, the greatest part while we are
doing nothing, and the whole of it while we arc doing that which is to
no purpose. In this sentence he seems to affect l cannot tell what
sort of witticism, which I do Ποῖ well understand. Le. I will guess,
if you will. Oa. Do so.

Lc. No man offends continually. But, newertheless, a great part
of one's life is lost in exesso, lust, ambition, and other vices, but a
much greater partis lost in doing nothing. Moreover, they are said
to do nothing, not who live in idloness‚ but they who are busied about
frivolous things which conduco nothing at all ῖο our happiness And
thence comes the proverb, Itis better to be idle than to be doing but
to no purpose. But the whole life is spent in doing another thing.
He is said, aliud opero, who does not mind what he is about, so that
the whole of life is lost; because, when we are viciously employed, we are
doing that we should Ποῖ do, when we are employed about frivolous
matters we do that we should Ποῖ do 3 and when we study philosophy,

. in that we do it negligently and carelessly, we do something to no

like it very well.

But in the meantime let us fall manfully upon the hon. I would
not have you mistaken,1 have no more provision ,fos you, and it agrees
with what went before. That is the basest loss that comes by negli-
gence, and he shews it by this sentence consisting of three parts.

But, methinlrs,1 see a fault a little after. We foresee not death-a
