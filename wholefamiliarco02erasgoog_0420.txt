courtier BETWEEN THALIA ΑΝΙ) Bnaanarsu. 413

Pl. Yes,I have something to say against it: you knew Oacusl
Bo. Who does not know Cacusl ro. That Cacus whom Virgil
speaks of. Bu. Iknew him. f'lt. Ibelievc you did, for he was a
famous fellow3 and as he was famous, just so are you. And then,
again, whereas you take it to your praise that the world follows you,
linterpret it rather to your dishonour5 for everything that is scuree
is valuable. There is nothing valuable that is common to the vulgar.
Although my admirersere but few, yet they are persons of figure and
gravity. But, pmy, what great reputation is it to you that you are
admired by the ignorant mobilityl Ba. Silly wenchl the thing is
quite different, for Ι do not leave those persons unlearned that I find
so, but Ι rather improve them and instruct them, and make them
persons of learning and gravity. fh. Ha, ha, ha, loaded with bookS,
but not with science. Bo. You are a poor serub, and Iam as well
ableto make my followers learned as you are yours. Pl. Yes, like
yourself ; for, being bai-barone yourself, you make barbarians of them
too: what can you do elsel

Bo. Now Ι find by experiencc the character is true that I heard
of you long ago, that you are a proting, impertinent baggage. Leave
off, simpleton, you know nothing at all ; this I am sure off, that if you
knew but half Ι know, you would not have the impudeneo to talk at
this rate. In my academy at Zwoll, what glory, discipline, and im-
provement is there! If I should but begin to enumerate you would
burst with envy. Ta YeS, forsooth ; and so I believe you would
make the very post aud pillars burst with your braggadoeia talking.
But, however, begin and burst me if you can. Bo. It is too long.
Th.. Well, make short of it then, you know how Bo. Well, then, 1
will speak in brief asto what Ι was saying before: nobody is able to
number the great confluente of studente that flock from all parts of
the spurious world to that famous school. Pa. Phoo; what, does that
great ass at Zwoll li mean the great bell of the school) bray so lond as 1
to call thom teget er in crowdsl Bo. Sillyton, forbear rading, and
hear what is said to you. They are there instructed and rendered
learned in a trice. l't. Wonderfully learned, indeed! Bo. In the
best glossas, vocabularies, arguments, and innumerable other notable
irratters. Ta, That is rightly spoken.

Bo. What do you grin atl Ι improve them to that degree that
there is nothing they are ignorant of. To. Ay, of nothing that is
novelty. Bo. As they grow in stature so they do in experionee ; and
being become perfect masters they are made instructore of others:
then I discharge them that they may live happily and die blessedly.
Th. Ha, ha, ha, I envy them so much, I can hardly forbear bursting
my sides with laughing. Ba. Fool, what do you laugh 011 Do you
think what Ῑ say deserves to be laughed etl To. Ι 0011 give you a
better account of the matter. Ba. What, youl rt. Yes, 13 and
if you please you shall hear it too. Ba. Well, begin then.

lt. As to the number of your followers, Igrant it 5 and if they
have learned anything right in schools before, they must be forced to
nnlearn it again. And then, aa 1ο those dispensatione (of which you
have reckoned up a great many), thoy are not so much instructed as
conforrnded by them, till at last they know nothing at all: you im-
provo them till they do not know so much as themselves. Their horus
