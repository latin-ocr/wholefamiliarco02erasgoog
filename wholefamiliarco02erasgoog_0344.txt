is hollowed a little, to make it enswerable to the bone to which it is
joined; tho other has no hollow at all to speak 01, and is not οο much
defended with a cartilaginous coat, but is only covered with a nerva and
a skin. Qu. Ι 000 11 very plain. Oh. The prone side has no nervcs
at all 3 but to the concavity 01 the supine 11011 0 nerve adherea to the
top of the right side and the bottom 01 the left Qu. Yon make it
out very plain ; but how must I know the right side from the leftl
Gt. That is very well minded, 101 Ι had instructed you very illy,
except you suppose 1110 10 mean the talus 01 1110 right leg. Ι will tell
you, and at the same time I will shew you the situation of it which
you desire to know The talus is in that bending of the lcg beneath
the hip. Qu. A great many are 01 0111111011 11 is ncar the foot.

ct. They are undere mistake. That which is properly called tho

⁶ talus is in the bending 01 the joints, which the Greeks call καμπὰς ; but
those of 1110 hinder legs, 11οΙ said before, between your 1001111111 your
knce, is the tibia. Qu. Why, so I think. Ol. Behind tho knee‚

καμπὴ. Qu. Iallow it. Ch. For those bendings which men have
in their arms, four-footed beasts have in their hinder legs3 but I except
the ape, which is hut half inan: and 0011101 which is tho knee in the
leg is thc elbow in thc 01111. Qu. Itakc it in. Ch. And so one
bending answers to another. Qu. You 1110111101 the fore-legs and the
hinder legs. Gt. You have it. So that in that heading which
unsvers to the bending which is behind the kn'ec the talus stands,
when a four-footcd beast stands uprigl1t‚tl1eupper and lower part of
which is a little bended, but not altogether after the saruc manner; for
the upper part 10 10111011 back into a sort of horns, as it were, which

Aristotle calls κεραίας ; Theodorus translates the word 0111011000, 11001
10 which the prono side gives way, the bettoni has no such thing.
Qu. I perceive it very plainly. Oh. Thereforo Aristotlc 00110 that
01110 which is towards the fore-legs supine, and that which is contrary
to it prone. Again, thero are two sides, 0110 01 which iuwardly is
towards 1110 hinder leg, either the right or 1011, suppose which you will,

the 011101· looks outwards ; 1110111111011100110111110111οΑ1101011000110κῶ101,

and that which looks outwards 1111011.

Qu. I see it plainly with my eyes ; but still 11010 10 11110 10 be done,
to inform 1110 what was the ancient manner of playing with these tali 3
for the play, as 11 10 used now-adays is quito different from what we
lind in ancient authors concerning this 0011 01 play. Ch. And truly
thetis very likely, as we in like manner now pervert 11101100 01 0111110
01111 dice 110111 the ancient manner 01 playing with them. Qu. What
you say is very probable. Ch. Theodorus (11110, 01, as others rather
chooso 10 call him, of Thessalonica, in translating Aristotle's second
book 01 his History of Animula, says, That thc 01110 01 1110 talus that
looks outwardly transverse, was called canis 3 and that which looks
iuwardly to the other leg, venus: and then he adds to it this 01 his

own, for Aristotle said no mora-Th μὲν πρανὲς ἔξω τὸ δε ὕπτιον
11010,καὶτὰμέν κῶλα ἐντὸς ἐστραμμένα πρὸς eththa, τὰ δε ἰσχία
