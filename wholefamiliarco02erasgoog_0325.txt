⁴could they have inflicted upon the maid if she had poisoned her
grandfathers and grendmothers, both of the father’s and mother’s side'l
Ga. Nay, if she had scattered her water upon the grave of her parents,
it would have been a punishment bad enough ιο have obliged her but
ιο have given a kiss to such a monster. Pe. I am of your mind.

Ga. Ι look upon it a greater piece of cruelty than if they had
stripped their daughter naked, and exposed her to bears, lions, or
crocodiles; for these wild beasts would either have spared her for her

himselfywlia hs Virgil tells us, bound dead bodies to living ones,
hande to hands, and mouths to mouths. But 1 do not believe Mezentius
himself would have been so inhuman as to have bound suche lovely
maid to euch a carcase as this; nor is there any dead body you would
not cboose ιο he bound to, rather than ιο such a stinking one; for his
hreath is rank poison, what he speaks is pestilenee, and what he
touches mortifica. Ga Now, Petronius, imagine with yourself what
a deal of pleasure she must needs take in these kisses, embraces, aud
nocturnal dalliances.

Pe. Ι have sometimes heard persons talk of uncqual matches;
that may certainly with the greatest propriety be called an unequal
match, which is, as it were¹ setting a jewel in lead. But all this while
I stand in admiration at the virgiu's couragc3 for such young damsels
arc frightened out of their wite at the sight of a fairy or a hobgoblin.
And can this damsel dare to embrace such a carcase as this in the
night-timet Ga. The damsel has these three things ιο plead in her
excuse—the authority of her parents, the persuasion of her friends, and
the inexperiencedness of her age. But 1 am amared at the madneas
of her parents: Who is there that has a daughter never so homcly
that would marry her ιο a leperl Pe. Nobody, in my opinion, that
had a grain of sense. If Ι had a daughter that had but one eye, and
hutone leg, and as deformed as Thersites was, that Homer speaks of,
and Ι could not give her a penny for her portion, I would not marry
her ιο such a son-in-law as be. Ga. This pox is more infectious and
destructive than the worst of leprosies; it invades ou a sudden, goes
off, and rallies again, and frequently kills atlast, while the leprosy will
sometimes let a man live, even to extreme old age. Pe. Perhaps the
parents were ignorant of the bridegroom’e distemper. Ga. No, they
knew it very well. Pe. If they had such a batred ιο their daughter,
why did they not sew her up in a sack and throw her into tho Themesl
Ga. Why, truly, if they had, the madness would not have been so

reat.
