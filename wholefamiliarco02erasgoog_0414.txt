tal body, when the same man, 11 he should be plunged down to the
lowest partos hell, would suffer nothing as to his felicityl Wheresoever
is a good conscience, there is God ; wheresoever God is, there is para-

true joy and sincere alacrity. Sp. But for all that, they would live a
more pleasant life 11 they were freed from some incommodities, and
enjoyed some pleasures which they either set light by or cannot atteia

‘those things that are concomitante ο1 humanity, as hunger, thirst, dis-

and werel Sp. These among the rest. He. But now we are talking
of immortal ones. And yet also in these calamities the condition of the
godly is much more tolerable than that ο1 those who hunt after bodily .
pleasures right or wrong. Sp. How sol

He. Because their minds are inured to temperance and bearance,
and therefore undergo those things which are inevitable more moder-
ately than other persons. And lastly, iu that they understand that all
those things are sent by God, either for the purgation of their saulis
or the exercise of their virtue3 and therefore they take them not
only patiently, but also willingly, as obedient children from the hand
ο1 a kind father, and are thankful either for His favourable correction
or for the great advantage got by them. Sp. But there are a great
