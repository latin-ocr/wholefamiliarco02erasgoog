country any better than othersl 09. I confess, as an ape will always
be an ape, so a skipper will always be a skipper; but i you compare
them to those that live upon the catch, they are angela. Μ e. Ι shall

again, Ι have led you out of the way.

09. In our journey to London, not farJ from Canterbury there is
anarrow, hollow, steep way, and a cragged, steep bank on either side,
so that you cannot escape it, for there is no other way to go. Upon

the left hand of that way there is a little cottage of old mendicante ⁴

sprinkled with holy water, and took it pretty well ; but upon presenting

the ahoe he asked what was meant hy thatf This, says the poor man,
was St. Thomas’a ehoe. Gratiam fell into a passion, and turning to me
said, What would these brutas havet Will they make us kiss the
shoes of all that have been good meni Why do they not as well give ,
us their spittle and the other excrementa of their bodies to kissf I
pitied the poor old man, and comforted him, being sorrowful, by giving
him a little money. Mc. In my opinion Gratian was not angry alto-
gether without a cause. If these shoes and slippers were preserved aa
an argument of moderatiori in living I should not dislike it, but I
think it a piece of impudencc to thrust slippers, aud shces,·and stock-

Op. Not to dissemble, Ithink those things had better belet alone ;
but in those matters that cannot be mended on a sudden, it is my way
to make the best of them. ln the meantime my mind was delighted with
thia contemplation, that a good man was like a sheep and a wicked man
like a hurtful beast. Α viper, indeed, cannot bite when it is dead, yet
it is infectione by its stink and corruption. A sheep, while it lives,
nourishes us with its milk, clothes us with its wool, and enriches us
by its increase ; when it is dead it supplies us with leather, and is
every part of it fit to be caten In like manner, men that arc furious
and devoted to this world while they live are troublesome to all
persons, and when they are dead are a disturbance to those· that are
alive, with the noiae of the belle and a pompous funeral, and sometimes
to their successore at their entering upon their possessione, by causing
new exactione. But good men make themselves profitable in all
respecta to the whole world. As this saint, while he was alive, hy hie

authority of the priesthood all over England3 and now, after all, this
