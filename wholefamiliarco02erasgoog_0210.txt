came to talk over the matter again, Faunus tells a mighty storyto
Polus, what great danger he had been in, and how courageously he
had driven both the evil spirits away with his charms, and now he had
arrived at a firm persuasion that there was no demon, let him be ever
so mischievous or impudent, that could possibly break into this circle
