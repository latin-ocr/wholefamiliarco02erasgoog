painter, and in both the goodness of God, who gives all things for our
use, in everything equally admirable and amiable3 and in the last
place, a garden is not always green, nor the flowers always fresh,
but this gardan is fresh and green all the winter. Ti. But it is not
fragrant. Ea. But, then, on the other hand, ,it wants no dressing.
rt. lt only delights the eye. Ena But, then, it does that always.
Ti. Pictures themselves grew old. Eu. They do so, but yet they
outlive us 3 and, besides, whereas we are the worse for age, they are
the better for it. Ti. That is too true, if it could be otherwise.

Ee. In this wallr that looks toward the west Ι take the benefit os
the morning sun, in that which looks toward the east Ι take the coel
cf the evening, in that which looks toward the south, but lies open to
the north, I take sanctuary against the heats of the meridien sun ; bnt
we will walk them over, if you please‚ and take a nesrer view of them.
See how green it is under foot, and you have the beauty oi painted
flevere in the very cheokers of the pavement. This wood that you
see painted upon this wall affords me a great variety of prospect ; for,
in the first place, as many trees es you see so many sorts of trees you
see, and all expressed to the life, as many birds as you see so many
kinds you see, especially if there be any scarce ones, and remarkable
upon any account; foras for gesse, hene, and duale, it is not worth
while to draw them. Underneath are four-footed creaturae, or such
birds as live upon the ground, aster the manner of quadrupeda Ti.

· The variety indeed is wonderful, and everything is in action, either

doing or saying something. There is an owl sits peeping through the
leaves ; what says shel aa. She speaks Greek. She says, Σωφρόνει

i πᾶσιν irrupt, she commanda us to act advisedly; I do not fly to all,
because an inconsiderate rashness does not fall out happily to all
persons. There is an eagle qnarrying upon a hare, and a beetle
interceding to no purpose; there is a wren stands by the beetle, and
she is a mortal enemy to the eagle. Ti. What has this swallow got
in her mouthl Eu. The herb celandine, don’t you know the plantl
With it she restores sight to her blind young ones. Ti. What odd
sort ol lizard is thisl Eu. It is not a heard, buta chameleon Ti.
Is this the chameleon thereis so much talk of l I thought it had been
a beust twice as big as a lion, and the name is twice as long too.
Eu. This chameleon is always gaping and always hnngry. This is a
wild lig-tres, and that is his aversion. He is otherwise harmiess ; and
yet the little gaping creature has poison in him too, that you may not
contemn him. Ti. But I don’t see him change his oolour. Eu.
True, because he does not change his place 3 when he changes his
place you will see him change his colour too. Ti. What is the mean·
ing of that piperl nc. Don't you see a camel there dancing hard
hyl rt. Ι see a very pleasant lancy—the ape pipes and the camel
danoes Eu. But it would require at least three days to run through
the particulare one by one; it will be enough at present to take a
cursory view of them. Yon have in thefirst spot all sorts of famous
plante painted to the life ; and, to increase the wonder, here are the
strongest poisons in the world, which yon may not only look upon but
handle too without danger.

rt. Look ye, here is a scorpionem animal very seldom seen in
this country, but very frequent in Italy, and very mischievous too.
