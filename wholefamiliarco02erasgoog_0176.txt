UONOERNING FAITH. 169

by us we had been all lost Aa. Why 001 Ba Because when we
were enemies tc God and worshippers 01 11010 fighting under Satan’s
bunner, that is to say, every way most accureed, then in an 00000101
manner He spshe to us by His Son, and by Η10 treating with us restored
us to life when we were dead. Aa That thou sayestis indeed very
true. Ba In truth it would go very hard with all such persons 11
1110 physician should avoid speaking to them whensoever any poor
wretch was seiaed with 0 grievous distemper, 101 then he hes most
occasion for the assistance of a doctor. Aa ButI 001 011011 that you
will sooner 101001 me with your distemper than Ι shall cure you 0111,
It sometimes falls out 11101 he that visits a sich man is forced 1ο be 0
lighter instead 01 aphyeician. Ba. Indead, it sometimes happens so
in bodily distempers; but in the 11000000 01 the mind you have 00
antidoto ready against every contagion. Au. What 10111011 Bo. A
strong resolution not 10 be removed from the opinion that has been
fixed in you. But, besides, what need you sear 10 11000010 0 fighter
where the business is managed by wordsl Aa. There is something
in what you say, 11111010 be any hope 01 doing any good. Ba. While ’
there 10 1110 there 10 hope, and according to st. Paul, charity cannot
despair, because it hopes all things.

Aa You observa very well, and upon this hope Ι may venture to '
discourse with yon 0 little 3 001 11 you will permit me,I will be a
physician to you. Ba Do, with all my heart Aa. Inquisitive
persons are commonly hated, but yet philosophcrs 010 allowed to be
inquisitiva 01101 every particular thing. Ba. Ask me anything that
you have 0 mind to ask me. Aa. I will try. But you must promise
1111111111111111011111111111111111111
01001. Ba Symbolum isindeed 0 military word. 1 will be content to
be looked upon an enemy tc Christ, 11 Ι shall deceive you 10 thie matter.

Aa Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, and who
made the heaven and earth. Ba. Yes, and whatsoever is contained
in the heaven and earth, and the angele also, which are spirits. Aa.
When thou sayest God, what dost thou understand by itl Ba. I
understand 0 0011010 eterna] mind which neither had beginning nor
shall have any end, than which nothing 0110110 either greater, wiser, or
better. Aa. Thou believest, indeed, liheagood Christian. Be. Who
by Η10 omnipotent beck made all things visible 01 invisible, who by
His wonderful wisdcm orders and governs all things 3 who by Η10
golpdncsp faede and maintains all things, and freely restored mankind
wmfflm

du. These are indeed three especial attributes in God. But what
benefit dost thou receive by the knowledge 01 1110011 Ba When 1
conceive Him 10 be omnipotent Ι submit myseli wholly to Him, in eom·
parison 01 whose majesty the excelleney 01 men and angele is nothing.
Moreover‚I firmly believe whstsoever the Holy Scriptures teaeh to
have been done, and 0100 that what He hath promised shall be dous
by Him, aeeing He can by His single beck do whatsoever He pleasee,
how impossible aoever it may seem 100100 And upon that account,
distrusting my own strength, I depend wholly upon Him who can do

all things. When I consider Η10 wisdom I attribute nothing at all to
my own, but 1 believe all things 010 done by Him righteonsly and ·
