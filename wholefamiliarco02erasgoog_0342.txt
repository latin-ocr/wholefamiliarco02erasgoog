ΤΗΕ GAME OF COCKAL. 335

and oftentimes theycome from abattle onefooted,and sometimes without
ever a leot at all. But, as sor the word, you would be more at a loss
if you were to read Horace, who attributes the tali to plays. For thus,
Ι think, he writes in his 101011Ρο0100-

Securus cadat, an recto stet sabula talo.

Being regardless whether or no the comedy fall or stand upon its
mlana. Poeta have a liberty of speaking as they plesse, who give
ears to Tmolus, and make ships speak and oaks dance. Ch. But
your own Aristotle could have taught you this, that there are hali tali,

which he calls ἡμιαστραγᾶλους, 1101 10 attributes to those beasts that
are 01 110 lynx kind. And he says that lions have that which is
instead 0111010100, but it is crooked or turned to and fro, and that

which he calls λαβυρινθὼδες, Pliny translates tortuosum [full 01 turn·
iuga and windings} And in the last place, bones are everywhere
inserted 1010 bones, for the conveniency 01 bending the joints ; aud
there are cavities for 110 receiving the prominenees that answer to
them, that are defended on each side with a slippery cartilage, the parts
being so environed, or kept in, that they cannot hurt one another, as
the same Aristotle teaches us. And there 10, sor the most part, 10
11000 something that answers pretty near both in form and use to the
talus. In the lower part 01 110 leg, near the heel, uberem the bend·
ing of the whole foot, there is a prominence which resembles the talus,

which the Greeks eall σφυρὸν. Again, we see iu the bending of the

knee a vertebra, which, ii I am not mistaken, they call ἴσχων. And
we also see something like this in the hips, in the shoulders, and,
lastly‚ in the joints of the toes and fingers. And, that it may not seem

strange 10 you, the Greeks write that the word ἆστραγαλος 10, 10
approved authors, applied to the bonesci which the spine is eomposed,
especially in the neck. For they quote you this verse—

, Ἐκ ds μοι αυχὴν ἀστραγάλων ἐάλη.
My neck-bone was broke on the autside the tali.

And, as Aristotle says, the sorelegs are given to animala upon the
account of swiftneas, and for that reason are without the tali; the
hind·legs for firmasse, because the weight of the body bears upon that

art, as also it contributes to strength in those creaturas that kick.
1101000, 10 signify that the play was 001 001 short but acted quite to
the end, says, Stetit fleo talo, and uses the word talus in a play in the
same 00000 00 we apply the word calx to a book, and also says 110
umbilicus uoluminis, or navel of a volume. Qu. In troth, you play
the part ol' a grammarian very cleverly. Ch. But to confirm it, the

more learned Greeks will have Ἀστραγαλος derived of στρέφω, and t
the privative particle a, because it is never bended, but is immovable.
But others choose to darive ἂστραγαλος from ἆστᾶγαλος, by inserting

the letter ρ, because it cannot stand'by resson 01 110 slippery volubility.

Qu. Ii you go that way 10 work, you may make a great many
more guesses; but I think it a fairer way 10 consess ignorance in the
matter. Ch. This gucss will not seem so very absurd if you consider
