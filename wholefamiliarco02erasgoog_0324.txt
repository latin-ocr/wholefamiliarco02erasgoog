THE UNEQUAL MARRIAGE. 317

young a girl to sueh an old follow as hel Ga. Kings do not grew old.
Pe But what makes you look 10 melancholy 1110111 11 may be you
snvy the happiness 01 the bridegroom, who has rivalled you. Ga
Pshaw, there is nothing 01 thatin the matter. Pe. Well, then, has
anything happened like what is related 01 the Lapithae’s 101111 Ga
No, not so neither. Pe What 111011, had you not wine enough? Ga.
Yes, and too much 100. Pe. Had you 110 piperst Ga. Yes, and
fiddlers too, and harpers, and trumpeters, and bagpipers. Pe. What
was the matter 1110111 Was not Hymen 11 the wedding 1 Ga. They
called loudly 101 him with all this music, but to 110 purpose. Pe Wers
not the (111001 111010101111011 Ga. Not a 10111 01111011, nor bridemaid
June, nor beautiful Venus, nor Jupiter Gamelius.

Pe. By my troth, you tell me a story 01 1 dull wedding indeed, an
ungodly one, or rather an unmarried marriage. Ga You would have

, said so, indeed, 11 you had seen it. Pe. Had you no daneing 11111

Ga No, but we had wretched limping. Pe. What, had you no luchy
godship at 111 10 exhilarate the weddingl Ga. No, not ouo there but
a goddess that the Greeks called Psora Pe. Why, you give me en
account 01 1 scahhy wedding indeed. Ga. Nay,a euulsered and a
poeky one. Pe. But prithee, friend Gabriel, tell me what makes the
remembrance 01 11 101011 tears from your eyesl Ga. Ah, deur Petro
nius, it 11 enough to 101011 10111 from a flint stone. Pe. I believe 10,
if a flintstone had been present and seen it. But, prithee, what
extraordinary 1111011101 11 111111 Do not hide it from me, nor keep my
expectation any longer in suspense.

Oa. Do you know Lampridius Eubulus 1 Pe. Yes ; there 11 not
a better nor happier man in the city. Ga. Well, and doyou know
his daughter Iphigenia 1001 Pe. You have mentioned the very
flower 01 the age. Ga. She is so; but do you know who she is
married 101 Pe. Ishall know when you have told me. Ga. Sheis
married to Pomponius Blenua Pe. What, to that Hector that used
to talk folks to death in craeking 01 his bullying trieksl Ga Tothe
very 111111. Pe. He has been for a long time very noted in this town
101· two things chiefly—ie, lying and the mange, which has no proper
name to it, though, indeed, it has a great many. Ga. A very proud
distemper, that will not atrike sail to the leprosy—the elephantine
leprosy-tetters, the gout, or ringworm, 11 there was to be 111 engage-
ment between them. Pe. So the sons 01 Eseulapius 1011 us.

Ga. What need is there, Petronius, 101 me 10 describe to you a
damsel that you are very well acquainted with, although her dress was
a great addition to her native heauty. My Petronius, you would have
taken 1101101 1 goddess had you seen her. Everything in her and
about her was graeesul. In the meantime out comes our blessed
bridegroom with his snub nose, dragging one leg 11101 him, hut not so
cleverly neither 11 the Switzers do, itchy hands, a stinhing breath,
heavy eyes, his head bound up with 1 foreheadpiece, and a running at

his 11010 and ears. Other people wear their rings on their fingere, but
110 wears his 011 his thighs. Pe. What was in the mind 01 the lady's
parents to joiu such a daughter to a living mummyl Ga. I cannot
tell, except it was witll thern as it is with many more that have lost
their 1011101. Pe. It may be he was very rich. Ga. He 11 very rich,
indeed, but it is 111 the debts he 01101. Pe. What greater punishment
