are as various. Among some of them there is an agreeableness and
mutual love, and among others an irreeeneileable aversion. And then
they are so tame and familiar that when I am at supper they will
eome flying in at the window to me, even to the table, and take the
meat out of my hands. If at any time Ι am upon the drawbridge you
see there, talking, perhaps, with a friend, they will some of them sit
heerkening, others of them will perch upon my shoulders or arms,
without any sort of foer, for they find that nobody hurts them. At

Ser. Sir, my mistress and maid say that the dinner will be spoiled.
Eu. Bid her have a little patience, and we will come presently. My
friends, let us wash, that we may come to the table with clean hands
as well as hearts, dre. The very pagana used a kind of reverenee in
this ease; how mueh mere then should Christiane do it, if it were but
in imitation ef that saered solemnity of our Saviour with his disciples
at His last supper. And thence eomes the enatem of washing of
hands, that if anything of hatred, ill-will, er any pollution should
romain in the mind of any one, he might purge it eut before he sits
down at the table. For it is my opinion that the foed is the whole·
semer for the body, if taken with a purified mind. Τι’. We believe
that it is a eertain truth. Era Christ Himself gave us this example,
that we should sit down to the table with a hymn ; and Ι take it from
this, that we frequently read in the evangeliste that he blessed or
gave thanks te His Father before He breke bread, and that He een-
eluded with giving of thanks. And if you plesse, I will say you a
graee that St. Chrysestom commenda to the skies in one of his
homilies, which he himself interpreted. Τι’. We desire you would.
Eu. “ Blessed be Thou, 0 God, who hast fed me from my youth up, and
providest foed fer all flesh: fill theu our hearts with joy and gladness,
that parteking plentifully of thy beunty, we may abeund to every
good work, through Christ J esus our Lord, with whom, te thee and
the Holy Ghest, be glory, honour, and power, world without end.
Amen.'’

Eu. Now sit down, and let every man take his friend next him.
The first place is yours, Timethy, in right of your grey hairs. ri.
The only thing in the world that gives a title ιο it. Ee. We ean
only judge ef what we see, and must leave the rest ιο God. Sophro-
nius, keep you elose te your prineipal. Theophilus and Eulalius‚
do you take the right side of the table 3 Chrysoglottus and Theodi-
daetus they shall have the left Euranius and N ephalius must make
a shift with what is lest. Ι will keep thia eorner. Τι’. This must net
be, the master ef the house ought ιο take the first place. Era The
house is as mueh yours as mine, gentlemen ; if Ι may rule within my
own jurisdictien, I will ait where I please, and I have made my ehoiee
already. Now may Christ, the enlivener of all, and without whom
nothing ean be pleasant, vouohsafe to be with us, and exhilarate our
minds by llis presenoe. rt Ihepe He will be pleased se to do, but
where shall He sit, for the places are all taken upl Eu. Iwould
