352 FAMILIAR comoedias,

Da Iwish Iwere. Er. I am told there is a certain compendiosa art
that will help a man to accomplish himself with all the liberal scientes
by a very little labour. De. What is that you talk ofl Did you ever
see the bookt Er. Ι did see it, and that was all, having nobody to
instruct me in the use of it. Da What was tha subject oi the bookl
Er. lt treated of various forms of dragous, lions, leopards ; and various
circles, and words written in them, semein Greek, some in Latin, and
semein Hebrew, and other barbarous languages De Pray, in how
many days' time did the titlepage promise you the knowledge ol the
arts and sciencest Er. ln fourteen De. In truth, a very noble
promise. But did you ever know auybody that has become learned by
that notable artl Er. No. Dc. No, nor nobody ever did, or ever
will, till we can sesan alchemist grow rich. Er. Why, is there no
suchart thenl Iwish with all my heart there was. De Perhaps
you do, because you would not be at·the pains which is required to
become learned. Er. You are right

Dc. It seemed meet to the divine being that the common riches,
gold, jewels, silver, palaces, and kingdoms should be bestowed on the
slothful and undeserving3 but the true riches, and such as are properly
our own, must be got by labour. Nor ought we to think that
labour troublesome by which so valuable a thing is procured ; when we
see a great many men run through dreadful dangers, and work their
way through unimaginable labonrs to get temporary things, and such
ss are really vile too, if compared to learning3 and do not always attain
what they strive for neither. But, indeed, the pains that studies eost
are mingled with a great deal of sweetness, if you make but a little
proficiency in them. And again, itis for the most part in your own
power to cut off the greatest part of the tiresomeness of attaining thena
, Er. How is that to be donel De. In the first place, by bringing
your mind to the love os studies3 and secondly, to admire them.

De. Consider how many learning has enriehed, how many it has ’
promoted to the highest honours. Then again, consider with yourselt
how great the difference is between a man and a beast. Er. You give

bring profit rather than pleasure. For those things that are honour·
able in themselves, although they are something troublesome in the ¹
beginning, yet they grow pleasant by use; and by that means you
will give the master less trouble, and you will more easily make a
progress ; according to the saying of Isocrates, which deserves to be

written in gold letters on the cover of your book: Ἐἆν ἧς φιλομαθὴς

ἴση πολυμαθὴς, If thou be desirous to learn, thou shalt learn many
things well. Er. Ι am quick enough at apprehension, but I presently
forget what I have learned. De. Then you tell me your vessel is
leaky. Er. You are much about the matter; but what remedy-is
there for itl De. Why, you must stop the chinka that it do not run
out Er. What mustI stop them withl De. Not with mess, nor
mortar, but with diligence. He that learns words and does not under·
stand the meaning ol them, soon forgets them; sor words, as Homer

weight of the meaning. Th0refore let it be your first care thoroughly
