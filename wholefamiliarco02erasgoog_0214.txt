pity on me, and vouchsafe to communicate ιο me that most happy
way of curtation. And by how much the better you understand this
art, by so much the less labour you will be able to impert it to me.
Do not conceal so great a gift from your poor brother that is ready to
die with grief. And as you assist me in this, so may J esus Christ ever
enrich you withmere sublime endowments.

He thus making ne end of his solemnity of obtestatione, Balbinus
was obliged to confess that he was entirely ignorant of what he meant
by longation and curtation, and bide him explain the meaning of
those words; then he began 2-Although sir, says he, I knowI speak
to a person thetis better skilled than myself‚ yet since you command
me I will do it. These that have spent their whole life in thia divine
art change the species of things two ways-the one is shorten butmore
hazardous, the other is longer but safer. Ι account myself very un·
happy, that Ι have laboured in that way that does not suit my genius,
nor could Ι yet find out anybody who would shew me the other way
that l arn so passionately desirons of3 bnt at last God has put it into
my mind to apply myself to you, a man of as much piety as learning3

it. 'l'hen Balbinus asked hini how much time it would take upl

Teo much, says he, almost a whole year; bnt in the meantime it is ι

the safest way. Never trouble yourself about that, says Balbinus,
although it should take up two years, if yon can but depend upon
your art.

Το shorten the story: they came to an agreement that the
business should be seton foot privately in Balbinus’s house, upon this
condition, that he should find art and Balbinus money, and the profit
should be divided between them, although the impostor modestly
offered that Balbinus should have the whole gain. They both toolr
an oath of secrecy, after the manner of those that arc initiated
into mysterious secrets; and presently money is pald down for the
artist tc buy pots, glasses, ceals, and other necessaries for furnishing
the laboratory. This money our alehemist lavishes away on whores,
gaming, and drinking. Pla. This is one way, however, of changing
the species of things. Lo Balbinus, pressing him to fall upon the
business, he replies, Don’t you very well know that whatis well begnn
is half donel It is a great matter to have the materiale well prepared.
At last he begins to set up the furnace; and here there was occasion

out a hait, so elohemists must cast gold in before they can fetch gold
out. In the meantime Balbinus was busy in his accounts, ior he
rechoned thus, if one cunce made fifteen, what would be the prodest of
