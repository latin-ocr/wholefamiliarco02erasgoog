Cretera· Oh', THE COSPEL cassisa. 325 ,

Ρο. 1133, I have known 3 111311 03113 the sheep 1111131303 and the
fex in his hesrt And I wish he had as candid friends as he has black
eyes, and that he had 33 well the value 01 gold 33 the colour 01 it.
Ca. If he 11131 wears a woollen hat must needs wear a sheep's head,
how do you 30 loaded that carry a sheep and an 03111011 100 on your
headl But does not he act more absurdly that carries a bird upon 1113
head, and an ass in his 11103311 Ρο. You bite 100 close. Ca. But it
were very well 11 that gospel that you have 30 1111313 adorned did reci·
procelly adorn you. You have adorned it with 00101113, Ι wish it did
adorn you with good manners. Po. Iwill make that my carc. Ca.
As you used 10 do.

Pe. But omitting all reflections, do you really blame those that
carry the gospel about 11131111 Ca. No, by 110 means (13131010 pontium).
Po. What, will 3011 333 11131 I am the least man in the world, that 3111
131131 111311 you hyan ass’s headl Ca. Ido not think you arc so
much tallcr, though the ass should prick up his ears. Po. By an ox's
head, I dare say. Ca. I like the comparis0n‚ but Ι said minime the
adverb, not mirrhae the vocative case. Po. Pray, what is the differ·
ence between an egg and an eggl Ca. And what is the difference,
say 3011, between the middle finger and the little 11113311 Ρο. Why,
the middle finger is the longest. Ca. Wittily said. What 13 1110
(1111313303 between the ears 01 311 333, and theseos 3 wolfi Po. The
ears 01 3 wolf are 31101131. Ca. You have hit it. Po. But Ι used 10
measure 10113 and short things by 1113 apaan and hythe 311, and not by
the 3313. Ca. Come 011. Ηο that carried Christ was called Chris·
topher; and instead 01 Polyphemus, you, who carry the gospcl, shall be .
called the gospel-bearer.

l’o. Do you 1101 think it a holy thing to carry the 3033311 Ca.
Notat all, unless you will allow me 1113133333 are the greatest saints.
Po. Why 301 Ca. Because 0113 333 will carry 31 least three thousand

such books; and I am persuaded you would bc able to carry 33 many .

30313311, 11 3011 were well hanrpered. Po. Ι 1111111111131013110 absur-
dity 111311111111111131101111033 10311 333 because he carried Christ. Cu.
I shall not envy you 11131 1101111333 ; and 11 3011 have a mind to it, I will
give you some 131103 01 11131 very ass that Christ rode upon to kiss.
Ρο. You will give 1110 3 very acceptablc present ; 101 that uss was con·
secrated by being touched by 1113 body 01 Christ. Co. And those
persons touched Christ too that 3111013 0111 Saviour 011 1113 1303.

Ρο. Β111 001110, 1311 1113 your mind seriously 3 is it nbt a picus thing
to carry the book 011113 3033013110111 01131 Ca. It is 3 picus thing, if
it be done 3111031013, and without hypocrisy. Po. Talk 01 hypocr-iay
to monks; what has a soldier to do with hypocrisyl Ca. But first
tell me what lrypocrisy is. Po. When a man seems 10 be 0113 thing,
and is really another. Ca. But what does the carrying 1113 303331
about you signisy; does it not 31311113 3 hely 11131 Ρο. Ι suppose it
does. Ca. Well‚ then, where a man’s life is not suitahle 10 1113 book,

is not 11131 hypocrisyl Po. It seems so 10 ba. But what is it truly ,

10 carry the gospel ’1 Ca. Some carry 1110 303331 111 their hands, as the
Franciscans do 1113111133 01 St. Francis ς and 31 11131 1313 the Paris

porters, asses, and geldings may carry it as well 33 a Christian. Sene

carry it about in their 1110111113, and talk 01 nothing but Christ and the

gospe13 this 13 pharisaical. Others carry it about in their 1103113 Η3
