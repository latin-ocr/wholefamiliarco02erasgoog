ICHTHl’OPHAGIA,· 012, FISII-BAYING. 283

I have heard say that the pope’s laws do by name except boys, old
men, and sick and weakly persons, such as work hard, women with
child, suoking children, and very poor people. Bu. 1 heve often
heard the same. Fi. Ι have also heard a very great divine, I think
his name is Gereon, say further, if there be any other case of equal

weight with those which the pope's laws except by name, the force of
the precept gives way in like manner. For there are peculiar habits of
body which render the want of some things more material than an
evident disease ; and there are distempers that do not appear that are
more dangerous than those that do, therefore he that is acquainted
with his own constitution bas no need to consult a priest; evenes
infanta do not, because their circumstances exempt them from the law,
And, therefore, they that oblige boys, or very old men, or persons
otherwise weak, to fast, commit a double sin; first, against brotherly
charity, and secondly against the very intention of the pope, who
would not involve them in a law the observation of which would be
pernicious to them.

Whatsoever Christ has ordered, He hes ordained for tbe health of
body and mind both; neither does any pope claim to himself such a
power, as by any constitution of his, to bring any person into danger
of life ; as suppose that any person by not eating in the evening should
not rest at night, and so for want of sleep be in danger of growing
light-headed, he is e murderer both against the sense of the churchand
the will of God. Princes, as oft as it suits with their conveniency,
publish an edict threatening with e capital punishment. How far
their· power extends I will not determine 3 but this Ι will venture'
to say, thoy would act more safely if they did not inflict death for any
other causes than such as are expresssd in the Holy Scriptures. In
things blameworthy, the Lord dehorts from going to the extremity of
the limite, as in the case of perjury, forbidding to swear at all ; in
murder, forbidding to be angry, we by a human constitution force
persons upon the extreme crime of homicide, which we call necessity.
Nay, as oft as a probable cause appears, it is a duty of charity of our
own accord to exhort our neighbour to those things that the weakness
of his body requires ; and if there be no apparent cause, yet it is the
duty of Christian charity kindly to suppose it may be done with a good
intention, unless it carries along with it a manifest contempt of the
church.

A profane magistrate very justly punishes those that eat contu·
maclously and seditionsly3 but what every one shall eat in his own
house is rather the business of a physiciun then a magistrate. Upon
which account, if any person shall be so wicked as to cause any dis-
order‚ they are guilty of sedition, and not the person that consults hia
own health and lircaks no law, neither of (lod nor man. In this the
authority of the pope is nrisapplied3 it is absurd to pretend the
authority of popes in this case, who are persons of so much humanity
that if they did but know a good reason for it they would of their own
accord invite them to those things that are for their health, and defend
them by dispensatione against the slanders of all persons; and besides,
throughout Italy they permit flesh to be sold in certain markets for the
sake of the hcalth of such persons as are not comprehended in that

law. Resides, 1 have heard divinos that have not been precise in their
