284 FAMILIAR destoueles

sermons say, Do not be afraid at supper-time ιο eat a pieee of bread,
or drink a pint of wine or ale, to support the weakness of the body.
If they take upon them the authority of indulging so that they will
indulge a small supper ιο those that are in health‚ and that contrary ιο
the ordinance of the ehurch, which requires fasting, may they not per-
mit not only a small supper but a pretty hearty one ιο such persons
whose weakness requires it, and the popes themselves expressly declare
that they approve ιιι If any one treats his body with severity it may
be called acal, for every one knows his own constitution best, but
where is the piety and the eharity of those persons that reduces weak
brother, wherein the spirit is willing but the flesh weuk, even to death’s
door, or bringing him into a disease worse than death itsulf, against the
law of nature, the law of God, and the sense and meaning of the law of
the pope himself l

Ba. What you mention brings to my mind what I saw myself
about two years since. I believe you know Eros, an old inan, about
sixty years of age, a man of a very weakly constitution, who by a
lingering illness, acute diseases, and hard studies, even enough ιο kill
a horse, was brought to death's door. This man, by some occult

quality in nature, had from a child a great aversion to eating fish, and ,

an inability ιο endure fasting, so that he never attempted them with-
out imminent hasard of his life ; at last he obtained a dispensation from
the pope ιο defend him against the malevolent tongues of some phari-
saical spirits. He not long age, upon the invitation of friends, goes to
the city Eleutheropolis a city not stall like its name, it was then
Lent time, and a day or two were devoted ιο the enjoyment of his
friends. In the meantime fish vvas the common diet 3 but he, lest he
gave offence ιο any person, though he had his necessity ιο justify him,
as well as the pope's dispensation to bear him out, ate fish. He per-
eeived his old distemper coming upon him, which was worse than
death itself3 so he preparas to take his leave of his friends and go
home, being necessitated so ιο do unless he would lie sick there.

Some there suspecting that he was in such haste ιο go because he
could not bear ιο eat fish, got Glaucoplutus, a very learned man, and a
chief magistrate in that province, to invite him to breakfast. Eros
being quite tired with company, which he could not avoid in a public
inu, consented ιο go, but upon this condition, that he should make no
provision but a couple of eggs, which he would eat standing, and im-
mediately take horse and be gone. He was promised it should be as
he desired; hut when he comes, there was a fowl provided. Ειόο,
taking it ill, tasted nothing but the eggs, and rising from table took
horse, some learned men bearing him company part of the way. But.
however, it came about, the smell of the fowl got into tho noses of some
sycophants, and there was as great a noise in the city as if ten men had
been murdered; nor was the noiso confined there, hut was carried ιο
other places two days’ journey off, and, as is usual, still gained by
carrying ; adding, that if Eros had not got away, he had been carried
before the justice, which, though that was false, yet true it was that
(llaucoplutus was obliged to give tho magistrate satisfaction. But
now, oonsidering the circumstances of Eros, had he ate flesh in public,
who could justly have been offended at itl And yet in the same oity

all Lent time, but especially on hely-days, they drink till they are mad,
