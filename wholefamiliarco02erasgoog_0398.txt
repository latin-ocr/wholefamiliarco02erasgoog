the cymindis, or nighthawk. And also an elephant hates amouse,
0 troublesome creature to mankind, and ¹will not touch a bit of
provender that it sees a meuse in, nor is there any manifest cause why
it hstes him so. It is with good reason it hates the horseloech, because
if it happens to sup it up in its drink it torments him miserably.

There is scaroe any animal that is more friendly 10 man than a
dog is, nor a greater enemy 10 him than a wolf, so that a man los'es his
speech if he sees him, and between these two there is the utmost dis·
cord3 as a wolf is the most bitter enemy to sheep, which have their
dependence merely upon the providence of mankind, whose care it is to
defend this harmless creature made for the nourishment of man. They
ars all in arms against the wolf, as against the common enemy of man-
kind, especially the whole army of dogs3 so that it is grown into 0
proverb, “I will give you no more quarter than a dog does to a wolf”
The scahare is an incurable poison to mankind, if anybody 10010 11
unawares, again, on the other hand, the touch of 0 man is death 10 that
hare. A panther isa very fierce beast towards 0 man, and yet is so
afraid of a hyaena that it does not darete engage him ; and hence they
say, that if anybody carry a piece of hyaena skin about him, a panther
will not set upon him, there is such a sagacity in their natural senss;
and they add also, that if you hang their two skins one over against
the other, the panther hair will fall off.

A spider is an animal that is one of a man’s own family, but is
very destructive to a serpent 3 so that if he happen to see a serpent
sunning himself under a 1100, 11 will, spin down and fix his sting so·
sharply in his forehead that the serpent will roll himself up, and die
01 last I have heard it told by those that have seen it, that there is
the like enmity between a toad and a spider 3 but that the toad cures
himself when he is wounded by biting of a plantain leaf. I will tell
you an English story: Isuppose you know it is the oustom there to
strew the floor with green rushes 5 0 00110111 monk had carried some
bundles of these rushes into his chamber, to strew them at his leisure,
and happcning to take a nup after dinner a great toad ereeps out and gets
upon his mouth while he lay asleep, fixing his feet, two upon his upper
and two upon his under lip. To draw otf the toad was certain death,

’ 10 101 him be there was worse than death itsclf. Some persuaded that
the monk should be carried and laid upon his back in the window
where a great spider had his web. It was done: the spider presently
seeing her enemy, spins down, darts her sting into the toad, and runs
up again 10 101 web; the toad swelled, but was not got off. The
spider spine down 0 second time and gives him another wound; it
swells more, but still is alive. The spider repeats ita third time, then
the toad takes off his feet and drops off dead. This pieee of service
the spider did her landlord Jo. You tell me 0 wonderful strange

00011 with my own eyes. An ape has an unmeasurable aversion to 0
tortoise3 a certain person‘gave me a specimen of this when Ι was at
Rome. He set a tortoise upon the head of his servant, and put his hat

upon it, and then brought him 10 110 monkey 5 the ape presently, with
