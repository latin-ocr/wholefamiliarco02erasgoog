isPolyphemus. θο. But it is AEgon’s¹ office to feed she-goats. Po.
But Ι had rather eat myself. Ca. That is apleasant wish3 you will
sooner be a hegoat' than a she one. I'o. ButI used esec for edere.
Co. Neatly spoken. Do you give liberally to the poorl Po. Ihave
nothing to give. θο. But you would have something to give if you
lived soberly and took paine. Po. But it is a pleasant thing to live

, at ease.

' θο. Βο γοα keep the commandmentsl Po. That isa hard task‚
indeed. Ca Do you repent of your sinsl Po. Christ has¹ made
satisfaction for us already. Co. How is it, then, that you make it
out that you love the gospell Po. I will tell you; there was α
certain Francisean with us, who, was perpetually thundering out of the
pulpit against Erasmus‘ New Testament. Ι caught the follow once by

himself, and took him hold hythe hair with my left hand, and nubhled

him so well-favouredly with my right, that you could seo no eyes he .

had for the ewellings. What ‹lo you say nowl Was not thia done
like a man that loves the gospell And after all this, I gave him absc
lution with this very book, knocking him over his coxcomb three
times, made three bunches upon his crown, in the name of the Father,
' Son, and Holy Spirit, and so absolved him in form. θα This was
evangelieally done without question. Thia is, indeed, a defeuding one
gospel with another.

Po. 1 chanced to light upon another, a brother of his of the same
order, who was still railing against Erasmus without either end or
measure. My gospel-zeal moved me once again, and Ι threatened him
so severely that Ι brought him to beg pardon on his knees, and
confess that what he said was by the instigation of thc devil. Ι stood
over him with my partisan in my hand, looking upon him like the
picture of Mars in a battle, ready to have cut off his head if he had
not done it readily3 and this was done in the presence of a great many
witnesscs. Oa. I wonder the man was not frightened out of his wits.
But to proceed, do you live chastelyl Po. It may be I shall when I
corne to be old But shall Ι tell you the truth, Canniusl θα. Ι am
no puisat, and if you have a mind to confess yourself you must eeek
somehod else.

Poyluse to confesstoGod,butf0r onceIwill do it to you. Iam
as yet no perfect, but a very ordinary Christian. We have four
gospelS, and we military gospellers propound to ourselves chiefly these
= four things :-lst. Το take care of our belliee3 2ndly. That nothing he
wanting below; 3rdly. To have wherewith to live on; and, lastly, To
do what we list. And when we have gained these four points, we
drink and sing as if the town was our own, Let the gospel live, and
Christ reign. θο. This is the life of an epicure, not of a Christian.

, Ρο. Ioannot deny that But you know Christ is omnipotent‚ and oan

make us other men in an instant if He pleases. Cu. Yeu, and He
may make you swine too, and that seems to bo an easier change than
into good men Po. I wish there were no worse things in the world
than swina, oxen, asses, and camels. You may find a great many
people that are fiercer than lions, more ravenous than wolvcs‚ more
lustfnl than camela-who will bite worse than dege, and sting worse
than vipera Co. But it is now high time for you to turn from
a brute to a man. Po. You say well, for Ι lind in the propheciae of
