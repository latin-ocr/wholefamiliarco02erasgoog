THE SEBAPHIO FUNERAL. 383

01 God would be undons; but go on. rt. And then, fourthly, He

discovered to him that none that lived impiously should long per-
severe in that order. Ph Why, does not he that lives wichedly 1011
110111110 orderl Ta. Nemore thau he that lives wichedly denies

Christ, although iu a 00100 they 1101 be said to deny God who profess ,

Him in words, but in works deny 11111. But whosoever has cast off
the holy habit, he 11101010111 10110 from 1110 order. Pa What shall
11111111 ‘t{grewesedesiderauerithenum
anything 01011. Ple.y St. Francis never wore a garmerit of that colour—
I mean a grey, nor a girdle 01 white linen ; and therefore, when they
come to knock at heaven’s gates, it will be said 10 them, ‘⁴ I never knew
you,'' 101 that they have not on the wedding garment. ·

Pd. Well‚ what, have you any morel Te. Yon heve heard
nothing yet 1ο what 10 behind. In the fifth place, He made known 10
him that those who were 01011100 10 the seraphia order, such as there
are but too many, the more is 1110 1111, should never live half the time
God had appointed them without making ‘away with themselves, and
that, unless they anticipated their 1010, they should suddenly come to
a miserable end. Ph. We have, among abundance of other 1101010011, Ι
0001 that made good in Matthew‚ Cardibal 01 Sedunum, who had a
very ill opinion, and spolie ill 01 the half-ahod fraternity3 101 he died,
⁵ Ithink, before he was full fifty years 01 age. rt. You say very right ;
then he had done injury to the cherubio order lihewise. For they
say it was brought about chiefly by his management that the four
Dominicans were burnt 01 Berne, when otherwise they would have
overcome the pope’s resentment by money. Pla But they say they
had begun to act 0 11000 01 most monstrous impiety. They attempted
by false visions and miracles 10 persuade people that the Virgin Mary
was polluted with original sin, and that St. Francis had 101 the genuine
marks 01 Christ’s wounds, and that Oatharina Senensis had them mora
· authentically, but had promised the most perfect 01 them all 10 the
layman they had converted and suborned 10 001 this farce, and had
abused the body 01 the Lord, 10 00111 01 the imposture, and afterwards
with clubs and poisons. And in the last place, they say that this pro·
ject was not carried 01 by oue university only, but by all the heads 01
the whole order. fh. Let that be 00 11 will, it was 101 without
reason that God said, “ Touoh 101 mine anointed.”

Pla Iwant to hear what 10 10 come. Ta The sixth revelation
is behind, in which the Lord sware to him that those that were
1010111010 01 1110 seraphia order, how wichedly soever they lived, should
one time or other obtain 110101 from the Lord, and end their wiehed
life with a blessed death. Ph, What if they should be caught and
killed 11 the 1011001 of adulteryl 11111101 God has promised
cannot fail of being performed. Pe. But what isit that they inter·
pret favour aud good-will byl th Oh, do you doubt 01 111011 Ηο
that gives them presente, that clothes them, furnishes their kitchen, he
loves them long ago. Pa. But does he not love those that give thern
admonitione and instructionsl ’ Te. They have enough of those things
01 horne, auditis their profession to bestow these benefits on other
1010010011 101101000110 them from them. Pa. Then the Lord has
2 promised more to the disciples of St. Francis than He has 1ο Η10 owu.
