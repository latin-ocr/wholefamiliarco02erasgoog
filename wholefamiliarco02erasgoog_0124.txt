chastely with her. The union 61 minds will be more than that 61
bodies. We will get subjecta 161 116 king and servants 161 Christ,
and where will the unehastity 61 1111 matrimony hel And who can
tell but we may live together like loseph and Maryl And in the
meantime we will learu to be virgins, we do not arrive at perfection
all at once. Ma What do you 16111611 Ι1 virginity to be violated
that it may be 1661116111 Pa. Why 11611 As by little aud little
drinking wine sparingly, we learn to be abstemious Which do you
think 11 116 most temperate person, he that is sitting at a table full of
delicaciea, and abstains from them, or he who is out 61 116 reach 61
11616 things that incito intemperancet Ma I think 1611116 most ,
temperate person that the greatest plenty cannot debauch. Pe.
Which is the most laudable for chastity, he that castrates himself, or
he that, having his members entire, forbears veneryl Ma The latter,
in my opinion: Ι should call the former a madman.- Ma. Do not
they in a manner. 66111616 themselves that abjuro matrimonyl Mo,
Ι think they do. Pa. Theu it 11 no virtue to forbear coition. Ma.
Is it nott Pa. I prove it thus: if it were of itself a virtue not 16
copulate, it were a sin to do it3 16 1161 11 follows of consequence, it is

a fault not toycopulate, and 6 virtue to do it. Ma When does this -

6616 happen‘l Mo. As often as the husband requires his due of his
wife ; especially if he would embrace her 161 116 sake 61 procreation.
Ma But if it be out of wantonness, is it 1161 lawful to deny 111111
Pa. He may be admonished or dissuaded by 1611 language to forbear;
but if he insists upon it, he ought not to be refused. But I hear very
Δ few husbands complaiu of their wives upon this account -q
Mo. But liberty is a very swoet thing. Po. Virginity is rather
a great burden. I will he your king, and you shall be my queen, and
we will govern the family according to our pleasure: and do you think
thatabondagci Ma. Marriage is called 61161161. Po. They deserve
a halter that call it 16. Pray tell 111611 1161 your soul and body bound
togetherl Ma Yes, Ι think they 616. Ρ6. Just like a bird in a
cage; and yet, ask it if it would be freed 116111 11, Ι believe it will say
no: and what is the reason of thatt Because it is bound by its own
consent
Ma. But we have neither 61 us got much portion. Pa. We aro
the safer 161 that-you shall add to it at home by good housewifery, and
that is not without good reason said to bea great ravenue, and I will
increase it abroad by my industry. Ma But children bring a great
many cares along with them. Po. And they bring a great many
comforts too, and oftentimes repay their parents' tenderuess with much
interest. Ma. Itis 6 grievous thing to bury one’s children. Pa
Why, you have 116116 nov, have youl What need is there 61 troubling
ourselves with that we do not know will be 61 11611 Pray, tell me,
had you rather not be born at all 61 16 16 born mortali Mo. Why,
indeed, Ι had rather be born mortal than not to be born at all. Pa.
And 16 that destituteness is the most miserable that never has had
children, nor ever will have, as those 616 happier that have lived than
those that have not, nor everwill. Mo. Who are they that never
hare been nor ever shall be bornl Pa Although he that refuses to
bear the chance 61 fortune, which all are equally liable to, whether 116 ·
be· kings or commonere, must go out of the world 5 yet, whatsoever
