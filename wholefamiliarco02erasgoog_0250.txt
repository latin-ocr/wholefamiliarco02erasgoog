ΤΠΕ RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGE. 243

cannot well tell which I admire at most, the impious confidence of
those wretches or God's patience.

Oq. At the north side there is a certain gete, not ofa church,
don't mistake me, but of thcwall that encloses the churchyard‚ that
has a very little wicket, asin the great gates cf noblemen, that he that

· has a mind to get in must first venture the breaking cf his shins and

afterwards stoop his head too, Mc. ln truth‚ it would not be safe for
a man to enter in at such a little door. Oy. You are in the right of

it But yet the verger told me that some time since a knight on ³

horsebaclr, having escaped out of the hands of his enemy, who followed
him -st the heels, got in through this wicket. The poor man at tho
last pinch‚ by a sudden turn of thought, recommended himself to the
holy Virgin that was the nearest to him, for he resolved to take
sanctuary at her altar, if the gete had been open. When, behold, which
is such a thing as was never heard of, both man and horse were on a
sudden taken into the churchyard and his enemy left cn the outside of
it starlr mad at his disappointment.

Mc. And did he give you reason to believe so wonderful a rela-
110111 09. Without doubt Me. That was nc easy matter to a man
of your philosophy. 09. He shewed me a plate of copper nailed on
the door, that had the very image of this lrnight that was thus saved,
and in the very habit whioh was then in fashion among the English,
which is the same we see in old picturas, which, if they are drawn
truly, the barbers and dyers and weavers in those days had buta bad
time of it Mc. Why sol Oq. Why, he had a beard like a goat,
and there was not a wrinlrle in any of hia clothes—they were made so
strait to his body that the very straitness of them made his body the
more slender. There was also another plate that was an exact descrip-
tion of the chapel and the size of it. Mc. Then there was no doubt
to be made of it 09. Under the little wicket there was an iron
grate, no bigger than what a man on foot could just get in at; for it
was not fit that any horse afterwards should tread upon that place
which the former knight had consecrated to the Virgin. Mc. And
very good reason.

Oy. From hence towards the east, there is another chapel full of
vendere, thither I went. Another verger received me. There we
prayed a little 3 and there was shewn us the middle joint of a man's
finger. Ikissed it, and asked whose relic it wast He told me it was
St. Peter's. What, said Ι, the Apostlel He said it was. Ι then
toolr notice of the bigness of the joint, which was large enough to be
taken for that ofa giant. Upon which, said l, Peter must needs have
been a very lusty man. At this, one of the company fell a laughing.
I was very much vexed at it ; for if he had held his tongue the
verger would have shown us all the relies. Howcver, we pacified him
pretty well, by giving him a few groats. .

Before this little chapel stood a house, which he toldus, in the win-
ter time, when all things were buried in snow, was brought there on a
sudden from some place a great way off. Under this house there were
two pits brimful, that were fed by a fountain consecrated to the holy
Virgin The water was wonderful cold, and of great virtue in curiug

pains in the head and stomach. Mc. If cold water will cure paine
in the head and stomach, in time oil will quaneh lira 09. But, my
