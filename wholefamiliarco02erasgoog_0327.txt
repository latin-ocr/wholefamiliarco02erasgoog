320 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

he would bring a mangy socundrel curto a well-brad bitehl Pe. N o ;
he would with the utmost diligende look for a dog that upon all
accounts was of a good‘breed, to line her, that he might not have
alitter of mongrels. Ga. and if a lord had a mind to bave a good
¹ breed of horsea, would be admit a diseased good-fornothing stallion to
leap a most excellent murel Pe. No, he would not suffer a diseased
stallion ιο enter his stable door, lest he should infect other horsea.
Ga And yet at the same time they do not mutter what sort of a sou·
in-law they give their daughters to, from whom those children aro to
be produced thatare not only to inherit their estates, but also to govem
' the state Pe. Nay, a country farmer will not suffer any bull to leap
a young cow, nor every horse his mare, nor every boar to brim bis sow 5
though a bullock is designed for the plough, a horse for the cart, and a
owine for the kitchen. See now how perverse the judgments of man-
lrind are. If a poor lellow should presumo to lriss a nobleman’s
daughter they would think the affront a foundation enough to go to
war upon. Pe. And very hotly ιοο.

Ga. And yet these persons voluntarily, knowingly, and delibor·
ately give up the dearest thing they bave in the world ιο such an
abominable monster, and are privately unnatural to their own flesh and
blood, and publicly ιο their country. Pe. ll the bridegroom does
but halt a little, although as ιο anything else he is perfectly sound,
bow is he despised fora husband l And is the pox the only thing that
is no inconvenieuce in a married lifol Ga. If any man should marry
his daughter ιο a Franciscan, what an abominable thing would it be
accounted! what an outcry would there be, that he had thrown his
daughter away! But yet, when he has pulled off that dress, be has

- every way well-made sound limbs ς while the other must pass her days

with a rotten cerense, thetis but half alive. If any oue is married ιο
a priest, heis bantered on account of his unction; but one that is married
to one that hus the pox has one whose unctions are worse by abund-
ance. Pe. Enemies that have taken a maid captive will not be
guilty ol such barbarity as this; nor will kidnappers themselves ιο
those they have hidnapped away ; and yet parents will be guilty of it
against their only daughter; and there is no magistrate ordained ιο
prevent the miscbief. Oa. How should a physician eure a madman,
if he has aspice of the same distemper himself.

Pe But it is a wonder to me that princes whose business it is to
take care of the commonwealth only in those things which relate ιο
the body, of which nothing isol greater moment than the health of it,
should find out no remedy for this evil. This egregious pestilenoe bas
inserted great part ol the earth, and in the meantime they lie snoring
on, and never mind it, as if it were a matter not worth their notice.
Ga. Have a care, Petronius, what you say as toprinces. But harh you,
Iwill tell you a word in your ear. Pe. Oh, wretched! Iwish what
you say were not true. Ga. How many disemes do you think aro
caused by bad wine, a thousand ways sophistieatedl Pe Why, is we
may believe the physicians, they are innumerabis. Ga. Well, and do
the ministers of stato take any careof the matter. Pe. They talto
care enough as to the collecting the excise, but no further. Ga. She
that knowingly marries a husband that is not sound, perhaps may
deservo to suffer the punishment she bas brought upon herself 3
