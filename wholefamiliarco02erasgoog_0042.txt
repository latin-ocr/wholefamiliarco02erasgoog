Ar. What did you see, thoul Oa. A grem deal ol barbarity
everywhere. Ar. But Ι hope you are come back more holy than you
went. Co. No, indeed, rather ten times worse. Ar. Well, but then
you are richeri Co. N ay, rather poorer than J ob. Ar. But don’t
you repent you· have taken so long a joumey to so little purposel
Co. No, nor I am not ashamed neither, Ι have so many companions os
my folly to keep me in countenance; and as for repentance, it is too
lata now. Ar. What, do you get no good, then, by so dangerous a

because you will have the pleasure of telling old storias when the
danger is overl Oo. That is something indeed, but that is not all.
Ar. Is there any other advantage in it besides thatl 0⁰. Yes, there
is. Ar. What is itl pray tell me. Uo. Why, Ι can divert myself
and company, as oft as lhave a mind to it, in romancing upon my
adventures over a pot of ale or a good dinner. Ar. Why, truly that
is something, as you say. Co. And besides,1 shall take as much
pleasure myself when I hear others romancing about things they
never heard nor saw; nay, and that they do with that assurance, that
when they are telling ,the most ridiculous and impossible things in
nature, they persuade themselves they are speaking truth all the
while.

Ar. Thisis a wonderful pleasure. Well, then, you have not lost

something better still than what they do, who, for the sake of alittle
advance money, list themselves sor soldiers in the army, which is the
rurrsery of all impiety. Ar. But it is an ungentlemanlike thing to
take delight in telling lies. Co. But it is a little more like a gentle-
man than either to delight others, or be delighted in slandering other
persons, or lavishing away a man's time or substance in gaming. Ar.
Indeed Ι must be ol your mind in that. Co. But then there is ’
another advantage. Ar. What is thatl Co. Il thero shall be any
friend that I love very well, who shall hoppen to be tainted with this
frenzy, I will advise him to stay at horne 3 as your mariners that have '
been cast away advise them that are going to sea, to steer clear of the
place where they miscarried. Ar. I wish yon had been my monitor
in time. 00. What, man! have you been infected with this disease
tool Ar. Yes,I have been at Rome and Compostella. ⁷ 00. Good
blod! how 1 am plessed that you have been as great a fool as 1!
What Pallas put that into your head 'l Ar. No Pallas, but Maria
rather, especially when I left at home a· handsome young wife, several
children, and a family wlio had nothing in the world to depend upon
for a maintenance but my dailylabour. Oo. Sure it must be some

Ar. There was a knot of neighbours ol us drinking together, and
when the wine began to work in ournoddles, onesaid hebed a mind
to make a visit to St. J ames, and another to St. Peter ; presently there
