106 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

green before you. If wc plesse we can keep out the air or rain by
putting down the sashes‚ if either of them be troublesome; andis the
sun is incommodious, we have thick folding shutters on the outside
and thin ones within, to prevent that. When I dine here I seem to
dine in my gardan, not in my house, for the very walls have their
greens and their flowers intermixed, and it is no ill psinting neither.
Here is our Saviour celebrating His last supper with His elect disciples.
Here is Herod keeping his birthday with a bloody banquet. Here is
Dives, mentioned in the Gospel‚ in the height of his luxury, by and by
sinking into hell. And here is Lazarus, driven away from his deors,
by and by to be received into Abmham’s bosom.

Ti. We do not very well know this story. Eu. It is Cleopatra
contending with Antony which should be most luxurious—she has
drunk down the first pearl, and now reaches forth her hand for the
other. Here is the battle of the Centaurs; and here Alexander the
Great thrusts his lance through the body of Clytus. These examples
preaeh sobriety to us at table, and detera man from gluttony and
excess. Now let us go into my librsry, it is not furnished with very
many books, but those I have are very good ones. ri. This place ’
carries a sort of divinity in it, everything is so shining.

Eu. You have now before you my chiesest treasure. You see
nothing at the table but glsss and tin, and Ι have in my whole housc
but one piece of plats, and that is a gilt cup, which Ι preserve very
carcfully for the sake of him that gave it me. This hanging globe
gives you a prospect of the whole world. And here upon the wall

' are the several regions of it described more at large. Upon those other

walls you have the pictures of tho most eminent authors. There would ,
be no end of painting them all. ln the first place, here is Christ sitting
on the mount, and stretching forth His hand over His head; the Father
sends a voice„ saying, “ Hear ye Him :” the Holy Ghost, with out-

librury there is a little study‚ but a very neat one 3 and it is but
removing a picture and there is a chimney behind it, if the cold be
troublesome. In summer-time it passos for solid wall. Ti. Every-
thing here looks like jevels, and herc is a wonderful pretty scent.
Eu. Above all things Ι love to have my house neat and swect,andbotl1
these may be with little eost. My librar-y has a little gallery that
looks into the ginden, and there is a chapel adjoining to it. Ti. The

have seen, that look into the kitohen gardera These upper walks have
a prospect into both gardens, but only by windows with shutters;
especially in the wells that have no prospect into the inner garden, and

J esus out of the history of the four evangelists, as far as to the mission
of the Holy Ghost and the first preaching of the apostles out of the
