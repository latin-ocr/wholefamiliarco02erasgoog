THE Baccara Dianoeas. 215

and that they may have the less reason to doubt, to perform the whole
operation with their own hands, while I stand at a distance, aud do not

eo much as put my finger to it. Ι put them to retine the melted matter
themselves, or carry it to the relinere to be done; I tell them before-
hand how much silver or gold it will afford. And, iu the last place, Ι
bid them carry the melted mass to several goldsmiths‚ to have it tried
by the touchetone. They find the exact weight that Ι told them-they
find it to be the fiuent gold or silvei-3 it is all one to me which itis,

except that the experiment in silver is the less chargeeble to me. Ir. '

But has your art no cheat in itl Mis. It is a mere cheat all over.
Ir. Icannot see where the cheat lies. Mis. 1 will make you see it
resentl.
p I filet make a bargain for my reward ; but Ι will not be paid before
1 have given a proof of the thing itself. Ι give them a little powder,
as though the whole business was affected by the virtue of that3 but I
never tell thom how to make it, except they purchase it at a very great
price And Ι make them take an oath, that for six months they shall
not discover the secret to anybody living. Ic, But I hare not heard
the cheat yet. arie, The whole mystery lios in one coal that I have
prepared for this purpose. I make a coal hollow, and into it [pour
melted silver, to the quantity Ι tell them beforehand will be produced.
And alter the powder is put in, I set the pot in such a manner that
it is covered all over, above, beneath‚ aud sides with coals, and Ι per-
suade them that thoart consiste in that. Among those coals that are
laid at top, 1 put in one that has the silver or gold in it 3 that being
melted hythe beat of the fire, falls down among the other metal, which

when another does it all with his own handel
Mis. When he has done everything according to my directior, be-
fore the crucible is stirred I come and look about to see if nothing has

been omitted, aud theu I say that there seems to wantacoal or two at the ⁸

top, and pretending to take one out of the coalheap, Iprivately lay on
one of my own, or have laid it there ready beforehaud‚ which Ι can
take, and nobody know anything of the nmtter. Ir. But when they
try to do this without yon, and it does not succeed, what excuse have
you to makel Mis, 1 am safe enough when I have got my money.
I pretend one thing or other, either that the crucible was crached, or
the eoals naugbt‚ or the fire not well tempered. And, in the last
place, one part of the mystery of my profession is, never to stay long
in the sanae place.

Ir. And is there so much profit in this art as to maintain youl
Mis. Yes, and nobly too; and Ι would have you for the future, if yon
are wise, leave, off that wretched trade of begging, and follow oms.
fr. Nay‚ I should rather choose to bring you bach to our trade dlis.
What l that I should voluntarily return again to that I have escaped
from, and forsake that which I have found profitablel Ir. This pro-
fession of ours has this property in it, that it grows pleasant by custom.
And thence it is, that though many have fallen off from the order of
St. Francis or St. Benedict‚ did you ever know any thet had been long
in our order quit itl For you could scarce teste the sweetneas of
beggary in so few months as you followed it. aa. That little teste
