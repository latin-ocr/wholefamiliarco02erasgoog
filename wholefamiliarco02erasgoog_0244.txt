victuale-and you had such a nurse, that I question whether there 10
such an one to be found-do you think there is any one in the world
will go through all the fatigue of nursing as the mother herself ; the
bewrayings, the sitting up at nigbts, the crying, the sickness, and the
diligent 0010 in looking after it, which can scaros be enoughl If there
can be one that loves like the mother, tben 0110 will take care like a
mother.

And besides, this will be tha effect of it, that your son will not love
you so heartily, that native affection being as it were dirided between
two mothers; nor will you have the same affection for your son So
that when be is grown up ho will neither be 10 obedient to you, nor
will you have the same regar-d for him, perhaps perceiving in him the
disposition of his nurse. The prinoipal step to advancement in learn-
ing is the mutual love between the teacher and scholar. So that 11· he
does not 1000 anytbing of the fragrance of 1110 native good temper, you
will with the greater ease be ableto instil into him 1110 pre-cepte of a
good life. And a mother 0011 do much in this matter, in that she has
pliable matter to work upon thetis easy to be carried any way. Fa.
I find it is not so easy a thing to be a mother as it 10 generally looked

“ 11 she continue in the faith.” You bave not performed the duty of a
mother before you have first formed 1110 little tendor body of your son,
and 0110111101 his mind, equally 1011, by a good education. Fa. But
it is not in the power 01 the mother that the children should persevero
in piety. ao. Perhaps it may not ; buta careful admonition 10 01
that moment, that Paul accounts it imputable to mothers if the chil-

in your power, (1011 will add his assistance to your diligence. Fa.
Indeed, Eutrapelus, your discourse 1101 persuaded me, if you can but
persuade my parents and my husband. Ea. Well‚I will take 11101
upon me, if you will but lend your helping hand. Fa. Ipromise

Yes, that you may and welcome. Do you hear, Syriaca, bid the nurse
bring the child. Ea. It is 0 very pretty boy. It 10 0 common saying,
there ought to be grains of allowance given to the first cressy, but you
upon the first trial have shewn the very highest pitch of art. Fa.
Why, it is not a pisce of carved work, that so much art should be
