recorded in Tertullian, a very ancient writer. And yet notwith-
standing, Ι do firmly believe it, both because it agrees with the
prophecy of the psalm, “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell ;” and
again, “0 Lord, thou hast brought my soul out of hell” And also
because the spostle Peter, in the third chapter of his first epistle (of
the author whereof no man ever doubted), writes after this manner,
“ Being put to death in the flesb, but quickened by the Spirit, in which
also He came and presched by His spirit to those that were in prison.''
But though I believe He descended into hell, yet Ι believe He did not
suffer anything there. For He descended not to be tormented there,
but that He might destroy the kingdom of Satan. Aa. Well‚ I hear
nothing yet that ie impious; but He died that He might restore us to
lile again, who were dead in sin.

But why did He 'rise tc life againl Ba. For three reasons
especially. Aa. Which are theyl Bo. First of all, to give us an
assured hope of our resurrection. Secondly‚ that we might know that
He in whom we have placed the sasety of our resurrection is immortal,
and shall never die. Lastly, that we being dead in sins by repentanoe‚
and buried together with Him by baptism, should by His grace be
raised up again to newness of life.

Aa. Do you believe that the very same body that died upon the
cross, which revived in the grave, which was seen and handlcd by the
disciples, ascended into heavenl sa Yes, I do. Aa. Why would
He leave the earthl Bc. Tbst we might all love Him spiritually,
and that n'o man should appropriate (lhrist to himself upon the earth,
but that we should equally list up our minds to heaven, knowing that
our Head is there. Foris men now so much plesse themselves in the
colonr and shape of the garment, and do boast so much of the blood of
the loreskin of christ, snd the milk of the Virgin Mary, what do you
think would have been had He abode on the earth esting snd dis-
coursingl What dissensione would those perulis-sities of His body
have occasionedl ο

Au. Do'st thou believe that He, being made immortal, sitteth at
the right hand of the Fatherl Ba. Why nott As being lord of all
things, and partaker of sll His Father's kingdom, Hc promised His dis·
ciples that this should be, snd He presented this sight to Hie martyr
Stephen. Aa, Why did He shew itl Ba. That we may not be
disocursged in anything, well knowing what a powerful defender and
lord we have in heaven.

Au. Do you believe that He will oome again in the same body
to judge the quick and the desdl Ba. As certain as I sm that
those things the propheta have foretold concerning Christ hitherto
have come to pass, so certain 1 arn that whatsoever He would have us
look for sor the future shall come to pass. We have seen His first

when He will come on high in the glory of His Father, before whose
judgmentseat all men of every nation and of every condition, whether
kings or peasants, Greeks or Scythiam, shall be compelled to appear3
and not only those whom at thst boming He shall find alive, but also
all those who have died frons the beginning of the world, even until
