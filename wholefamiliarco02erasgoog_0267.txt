260 FAMILIAR consodales

as if new killedl Bu. But nebody ever knew such an instance 01 us
as hasbeen known by you lately, that nine persons were poisoned by
one eel baked in a pie. And this is what you furnich citizens’ tables
with. la: What you speak 01 was an accident; and nebcdy can help
that, when it pleases (led it shall fall out so. But it is a daily practice
with you te sell young eata for rabbits, and puppies fer hares, if peeple

de net know them by their ears and rough feet3 not to speak 01 your
meatpies made 01 dead men's flesh.

Ba. That which you charge me with ia the lailings 01 men in
common, and let them defend themselves that are guilty 01 the fault.
Imake my comparison between gain and gain. By the same reason
you may condemn gardeners, who, by mistake, sell henhane sor cole
worts ; or apothecarios, who administer poison instead 01 antidotes.
There is ne trade or calling that is not liable to these mistakes. But
you, when you act the most saithsully in your calling, sell that which
is poison. Is, indeed, you sold a crampfish, avator-snake, or a seahare,
caught among other fish, it would he an accident rather than a fault.
Nor do Ι think it any more te be imputed to you than to a physician,
that sometimes kills the patient he undertakes te eure. And this
might be exeusable if you only put off your stinking wares in the
winter season ; then the cold might mitigate the contagiousness 01
infectior ; but you add putrid matter to the fire 01 the summer season,
and render autumn, which is 01 itself a sickly season, more sickly.
And in the spring 01 the year, when the lrumours that have been
lecked up begin te ilow to the hasard of the body, then sor two whole
months you exercise your tyranny and corrupt the insaney 01 the
springing year, by bringing au old age upon it. And when nature is
busied to purge the body irem unwhclesome juices and make it fresh
and blooming with new, you threw into it more stinks and corruption ς
so that if there be any vicious humours in the body you increase them,
adding worse to bad, and net only so, but corrupting the good juices of
the body. But this might be borne with too if you only injured the
body; but inasmuch as by different foods the organa 01 the mind are
vitiated, you vitiata the very miuds themselves. So that debut mind
your fish-eaters, how like fislrcs do they look, pale, stinkiug, stupid,

Fi. Oh, rare Thales! But, prithee, how wise are they that live
upon beetsl just as nruch as the beets themselves. What sort 01

delieacy, and yet this creature is very bad sor the falling-siekness, and
brings that distemper upon the sscsheatcrs. Were it not better to
satisfy a craving appetite with salt fish l Bu. Dc you think, then, that
all that your naturalists write is truel But were what they say ever
so true, itis certain that to serae persons that are inclinable te diseases,
those things that are good 01 themselves prove hurtful. We sell kids
