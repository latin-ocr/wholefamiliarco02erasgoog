threatened 116 would break open the door if his wife did not open it,
they were in bodily 1661 within, and cast about for some present

resolution 3 ¹and, circumstances admitting no better, 116 pulled off his
coat and threw himself 6111 61 a narrow window, but not without both
danger and mischief, and 66 got away.

Such stories as these, you know, 616 soon spread, and it came to
Balbinus's ear, and the chemist guessed it would be so. Ph. There

countcnance that he was no stranger 16 1116 talk of 1116 town The
chemist knew Balbinus 16 116 a 111611 61 piety, and 111 some points, Ι
was going to say, superstitious, and 611611 persons are very ready to

fore he on purpose begins 6 talk about the success of their business,
complaining that it had not succeeded 66 11 used 16 do and as he would
have 11, 61111 116 wondered greatly what should be the reason 61 11.

Upon this discourse, Balbinus, who scemed otherwise to have
been bcnt upon silence, taking an occasion, was a little moved. Itis
no hard matter, says he, to guess what the ,6161661616 Sina are the
obstacles that hinder our success, 161 pure works should be done by
pure persons. At this word the projectos fell down on his knees, and
beating his breast with a very mournful tone and dejectcd counte-
uance, says, O Balbinus! what you have said is very 11116, 11 16 6111, 11
16 6111 that has been the hindrance 3 11111 mysius, 1161 161116; 1611 arn

am, 61 6 priest I 6111 become an adultcrcr; and yet tho offering that
you sent to the virgin mother is not wholly lost neither, 161 Ι had
perishod inevitably if she had not helped me; 161 1116 husband broke
open the door upon me, and 1116 window was too little 161 mo to get

had known the knave from a child. He easily imagining that he was
acting the same part with Balbinus 11161 he had been acting everywhere,
admonishcs Balbinus privatcly, and acquainted him what sort of
