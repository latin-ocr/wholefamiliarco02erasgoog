place, do not attempt to do that which is impossible ιο be done. Sp.

What is thatl Ap. Το be a master of a feast, and give satisfaction to
all your guests, when there is a great variety of palates. Sp. Well,
then, that Ι may displease but a fewl Ap. Call but a few. Sp. But
that cannot be. Ap. Then invite those that are equale and of agree-
able humours. Sp. Ι am notat liberty to do that neither, I cannot
avoid inviting a great many, and of different humours, nor are they
all of the same speech or nation. Ap. You talk of a bedlam rather
than a banquet. Here will necessarily arise such confusion as the
Hebrews relate to have happened at the building of Babol, that when
one asks for oold water the other will bring him hot. Sp. But,
prithee, help me out at a dead lift; you shall find I will be both mind-
ful of and grateful for your good office

Ap. Well, come, then; seeing you are not at liberty to pick and
ohoose your guests, Ι will give you advice in this difficult point. Ιι
significa no small matter aa ιο the mirth of the entertainment what
places any of them sit in. Sp. Thetis very right. Ap. But to take
away all occasion of uneasiness, let them cast lots for their places.
Sp. That is well advised. Ap. Lot not your dishes proceed gradu-
ally from the upper to the lower end of the table, so as to make the
letter Σ, or rather in a serpentine order, or ιο ιο changed reciprocally
hither and thither, as the myrtle in old times used ιο ιο handed about
at banquets. Sp. How thenl Ap. Το every four guests set four
dishes, so that the fourth may be the middlemost, as boys upon three
nuts set a fourth ; in every one of these let there be a different sort of
victuals, that every one may help himself to what he likes.

Sp. Well, 1 like that very well; but how often must l change the
dishesl Ap. How many parts are there in a theatrical orationi Sp.
Five, l think. A p, How many acts are there in a playl Sp. Ι have
read in 'Horace that they ought not ιο exceed five. Ap. Well, then,
so many different courses you must have. Lot the first course be soup,
and the last a dessert of sweetmeats. Sp. What order of the courses
do you approve ofl Ap. The same that Pyrrhus did in his army.
Sp. What say you l· Ap. As in an oration so at a feast, the preface
or first courses should not be very delicate; and again, the last course
should rather excel in variety than daintiness. So Pyrrhus’s discipline
consisted in three particulare, that on each side there should be some-
thing excellent, and in the middle that which was more ordinary. By
this method it will be so ordered that you will neither appear ιο be
sparing nor prodigal by reason of a cloying abundanee.

Sp. The eating part is well enough contrived; now tell me what
is to be done as to drinking. Ap. Do not you give the cup to any·
body ; leave that to your servants, ιο, ask everybody what sort of wine
he likes, and to fill every one the wine hc drinks readily at the very
first call or nod. In this there will be a twofold conveniency, they
will drink both more eparingly and more merrily; not only because
every now and then there would otherwise be a different sort of wine
given them, but also because nobody will drink but when he ia dry.
Sp. Upon my word, thiais very good advice. But then, how will they
all be mado merryl Ap. That is partly in your power. Sp. How
is thatl Ap. You know the old proverb, A hearty welcome is the
best eheer. Sp. How is thatl Ap. Entertain them courteously,
