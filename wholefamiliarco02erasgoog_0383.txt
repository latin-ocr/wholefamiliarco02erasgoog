their dinner, and at least two hours at supper3 and unless their bellios
010 well filled with good wine, flesh, and fish, they run away from their
masters, and go into the army.

Gi. Every nation has its peculiur eustoms; the Italians lay out
but very little upon their bellies; they love money better than plea-
sure; and this temperance they owe rather to nature than custom.
Ja Now, truly, 1 do not wonder you are come home solean, but rather
that you are 00110 home alive, especially since you were so used to
capons, partridges, pigmus, and pheasants. Gi. Why, in truth,1 had
very fairly trooped o , unless I had found me out a remedy. Ja. lt
is but poor living where such frequent recourse must be had to reme-
dies. Gt. Ι brought matters about so that 1 had the fourth part of a
boiled pullet allowed to every mccl, to keep up my languishing spirits.
.Ιο Ay, marry, now you begin to live! Gt. Not altogether so well
as you imagine 5 for old Gripo bought the least he could lay his hands
on, to save expensos, such that six of them would not serve a Polander
of a tolerable stomach for a breakfast ; and when he had bought them,
he would give them no corn, because he would not put himself to
extraordinery charges; so a wing or a leg of the fowl that was half
starved before it was put into the pot, was boiled sor my dinner, and
the liver always went to Orthrogonus’s little son ; and es for the broth,
the women were perpetually lapping it up, and every now and then
they put in fresh water3 so that by that time it came to me it was as
dryas a ehip, and no more teste in it than the foot of a jointstool.
And as sor the broth, it was nothing but a little water bewitched Ja.
And yet Ι hear that you have all sorts 01 fowl there in great plenty,
very good and very cheap. Gi. They are 00, but money is hard to
come by. Jo. You have done penance enough, one would think, if you
had murdered the pope, or pissed against St. Poter's tombstone.

Gi. But bear the rest ofthe 10100 out. Yon know there are five
days in a week that we may eat flesh on. J a. What thenl Gi. He
only bought two pullets for the whole week. On Thursday he would
pretend he forgot to go to market, lest I should either have a whole
pullet on that day, or any should be left. Jo. In short, I think your
landlord was a greater miser than Eulio in Plautus. But what course
did you take to keep yourself alive upon hah-daysl Gi, I employed
0 0011011 friend to buy rne every day three eggs with my own money-
two for my dinner, and one for my supper. But here also the women
put their tricks upon me 3 for instead of my new-laid eggs that 1 paid
a good price for, they would give me rotten ones, that l thought Ι camo
well off if one 01 my three eggs proved estable. I also at last got a
small oask 01 good wine bought for my own drinking, but the women
broke open my cellar-door, and in a few days dronk it all up, and
my lendlord‚ Autronius, did not seem to be much displeased at the
matter.

Jc. But was there nobody in the family that took pity on youf
Gi. Take pity on me, say you l N o; they thought me a glutton and
a cormorant, who by mysels devoured so much victuale. And upon that
account Orthrogonus would ever and anon give mo good advice, that Ι
