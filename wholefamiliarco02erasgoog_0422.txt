CONFLIOT BETWEEN THALIA ΛΝΒ BARBARISM. 415

ν mouth now; Ι will break this silence. Bo. Ι might have said that
more justly 01 your partinens. lt. Ι have broken it. Ba. Tboss
that do not understand our poetry do not know how to do anything,
but 10 laugh and scoff. Th. They are such, 1101110 11100 understands
them he will be never the wiser ; and 1111011000 1101,,10 will know never
the less

Bc. There is no need 01 0 great many words, the thing proves itself.
Th. The thingprove itselfl Ishould be glad to 000 that. Bc. 1111000
those persons which the knowledge of things has rendered 10111000. Th.
10 there any one such personl Bo. Yes‚ without number. Th.
That is well said, es if nobody could number tbem; 101 nobody 0011
number that which is hutone, and not that neither. However you
11111111111111111111111111111111111011·
Th. But not sweet-smelling'ones. lia. Thon here is Papias. Th. A
very learned man, indeed! you ought 1ο 11ον0 named him lirst. Bo.
Then here is Huguitio. ΤΙι.Ι Avery famous man! Bo. And Michael
Modista. nt. An excellent onel Ba. Tben hereisJamesGlosarius. ,
Th. A wonderful man l Ba. And him that I esteem above them 011,
John de Garlandia, who excels in such an elegauoy 01 words, and such
0 majesty 01 stylo, that there are but very few that can understand him.
rt. Nay, nobody 01 011, unless they 010 barbarizans as well 00110 ; 101
how can anybody easily understand him who did not well understand
1111100111

Bc. There 10 no end in talking with you 3 you outdo me in words,
butI do not think victory consiste in them. Ι1 you have a mind to it,
let ns each of us try what we can do. Do you make versos with me.
Come, do not stand shivering and shaking, nor shilly-shally3 I am
ready 101 you; then it will appear whether 0100 gets the better. Th.
Ι like it very well. Oome on, let us try. But, Mistress Poetess‚ do
you begin first. Ba. These are verses 11101 Ι have often repeated in
the presence 01 very learned men, and not without the great admiration
01011 osthem. Th. I believe so; now begin.

Ba. Zwollenses tales, quod eorum Theutonicales
Nomen per partes ubicunque probantur 0101100,
Ε1 quasi per mundum totum sunt 11010 rotundum,
Zwollensique solo proferre latinica solo
Discunt clericuli nimium bene verba novelli

These verses are 0 demonstration how elegante poet I am. Th. Ha, Ι
10, 10 ; they 00010111 as many barbarisms as words. This, to be sure, is
certainly your father's speech‚I mean Ohiron's ;a poem excellently
composed ; Ι will not defer giving it its just due.

Tale sonant insulsa mihi tua carmina, vates,
Quale sonat sylvis vox irrudentis onagri3
Quale boat torvus pecora inter agrestia taurus 3

. Quale testiculis gallus genitalibus orbus
Concinit haud vocem humanam, sed dico ferinam.
Hanc celebres laudate viri, et doctissime florum
Auctor ades ; gratos in 00110 nitentis flores
Colligito‚ meritaque coronam nectito diva 1
