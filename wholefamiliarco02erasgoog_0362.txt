11, 10111010 that werethe most 1010010110 10 him toolr it to be 1110
effect 01 his wine, and loolred upon it accordingly. Le. But what

0110010 badhe when he was reproved 101111 Hi. He said he did not '

speap it seriously'. 10. Seriopslyp how should he, when 110 had
0011 01 1000010011 nor sense 1n 1110

Hi. But it is, in my opinion, and also of all learned men, an
insufferable thing that this nasty fellow should set forth his nasty
ware so publicly in 10 1000111110 0 place, before such an 1101111011, and
10 the hearing 0110 many great princes 10. Ι am with child to hear
what it was 110 said. lli. He foolishly raved against our Erasmus,
saying a great many scurvy things 01 him, the substance 01 which was
as follows :-⁴There is, says he, in our days a new upstart doctor called
Erasmus. My tongua failed me, I would have said Asinus. Then he
informed the people what Asinus signified in the German tongue. La.
A very 00101001 fancy! Hi. Was it so very comical, do you thinkl I
think it was rather very foolish. 10. Was it not very comioal that
such an ass as he should oall anybody ass, and much less Erasmusl I
101 confident had Erasmus been thera he would not have forborne
laughing. Hi. 10 truth, he resembles an assas much by his stupidity
as he does by the 00100101 his clothes. 10. I believe all Arcadia does
not produce 10 111 that is 10 much 01 10 ass, or better deserves to bs
fed with hay than 110 does. Hi. In short, he is Apuleius turned inside
out; 101 Apuleius hid a man under the form of an ass, but this fellow
hides an ass under the shape 01 0 man. 10. 10 short, we make so
many of these asses pampered with 11001011(11101101,11111111100
wonder 11 they bite and kick all that come near them.

Hi. This doctor ass, says he, presumas to correct the Magnifieat,
notwithstanding it is a song of the Holy Spirit‘s own inditing, pro·
nouncgd by the mouth 01 the most holy Virgin herself. 10. Ι know
„ the proverb 011110 brothers. Hi And then be 1011 11001 in words 01
though it was the utmost pitch 01 blasphemy. 10. Now my beart
001101 101 1001 01 the crime committed. Hi. Why, 110 said Erasmus
had translated that which the 01101011 0101 10 the litany in these
words z—Quiu respexit Dominus humilitatem 00011110 surr, thus, Qui
respexit 0111101001 00011110 auu-Because the Lord bath regarded the low·
11001101 his haudmaid; he has translated it, The Lord hnth regarded
the 11100011 01 his handmaid, And that word sounds worse in high
Dutch than it does in Latin. 10. Who will not own that it were a
horrid blasphemy 101 any 000 10 0011 the most holy mother of Christ
(who was higher iu dignity than the angele themselves) a vile hand·
maidl Hi. Why, suppose any 000 should cell the apostles them·
salves unprofitable servantsl 10. Ι would find laggots to burn such a
blasphemer. Hi What 11 any one should say that famous apostle
Paul was unworthy the name 01 10 apostlel 10. Ι would have him
hurned 101 0 11010110. 111 And yet Christ himself, that toacher who
000001 be reluted, taught His apostles to spealr 11101 this manner :—
“When you 11010 (1000 whatsoever is commanded you, say, we are
unprofitable servants.” And St. Paul, 001 unmindful 01 this oommand,
says 0111101011, “I am the least 01 111 the apostles‚ and not worthy tho·
name 0110 apostle.'’ 10. Ay, but when godly 1000 say such things of
themselves, it is their modesty, than which nothing is more well·
ploasing to (lod. But ifanybody else should say such things 01 them,
