better if they were concealed ; and there are some nnlearned and
foolish fellows who, for the sake of filthy gain, lend their ear, but apply
not their mind, who cannot distinguish between a fault and a good
deed, nor can neither teach, comfort, nor advisa. These things Ι have

heard from many, and in part have experienced mysclf Ga. And I,
too, much ; therefore, I choose me one that is learned, grave, of
‚ approved integrity, and one that keeps his tongue within his teeth.
Er. Truly, you are happy that can make a judgment of things so carly.

Ga. But, above all, Itake care of doing anything that I cannot

¹ safely trust a priest with Er. Thetis the best thing in the world,

if you can but do so. Ga. Indeed, itis hard to us of ourselves, but
by the help of Christ it is easy; the greatest matter is, that there be
a will to it. Ι often renew my resolution, especially upon Sundays3
and, besides that, Ι endeavour as much as I can to keep out of evil
company, and associate myself with good company, by whose conversa

for evil conversations corrupt good manners Ga. Ι shun idleness as
the plagae. Er. Yon arc very right, for idleness is the root of all

, cvil; but, as the world goes now, he must live ογ himself that would

keep out of bad company. Ga What you say is very true, for, aethe
Greek wise men said, the bad are the greatest number. But Ι choose
the best out of a few, and sometimes a good companion makes his
companion better. Ι avoid those diversione that incita to naughtiness,
