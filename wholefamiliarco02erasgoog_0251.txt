good friend, you are hearing that which is miraculous 3 for what miracle

is there in cold water quenching thirstl Ma That shift goes a
great way in this story. 09. It was positively affirmed that this
pprlingV burst out of the ground on a sudden at the command of the
o rr m.

yI, observing everything very diligently, asked him how many
years it was since that little house was brought thitherl He said
it had been there for some ages. But, said I, methinks the walls don’t
seem to carry any marks of antiquity in thern He did not much
deny it. Nor these pillars, said Ι. Hc did not deny but those had
been set up lately 3 and the thing shewed itself plainly. Thcn, said I,
that straw and reoda, the whole thatch of it seems not to have been so
long laid. He allowed it. Nor do these cross beams and rafters that
bear up the roof seem to have been laid many years ago. He oon-
fessed they were not. And there being no part of that cottage remain-
ing, said I to him, How then does it appear that this is the very cottage
that was brought so far through the airl Me. Prithee‚ how did the
sexton extricato himself out of this difficultyl 09. He presently
shewed us an old bear's skin taoked there to a piece of timber, and
almost lauglred at us to our very faces for not having eyes to per-
ceive a thing that was so plain. Therefore, seeming to be satisfied, and
excusing our dulness of apprehension, we turned ourselves to the
heavenly milk of the blessed Virgin.

Me. Omother like her Son! forasHe has left us so much of His
blood upon earth, so she has left us so much of her milk, that it is
scarce credible that a woman who never had but onc child should have
so much, although her child had never sucked a drop. 09. And they
tcll us the same stories about our Lord’a cross, that is shewn up and
down both publicly and privately in so many places that if all the
fragments were gothered together, they would seem to be sufficient
loading for a good large ship 3 and yet our Lord himself carried the
whole cross upon his shouldcrs. Me. And don't you think this is
wonderfull 09. It may be said to be an extraordinary thing, but
not a wonderful one, since the Lord, who increases these things accord·
ing to His own pleasure, is omnipotent. Me. You put a very picus
construction upon it, but 1 am afraid that a great many such things are
forged for the sake of getting money. 09. Ι cannot think God would
suffer any one to put these mockcries upon =Him. Me. Nay, when
both the mother and Son, Father and Spirit are robbed by sacrilegious
persons, they don't seem to be moved the least in the world, so as to
deter wicked persons, so much as by* a nod ora stamp‚ so great is the
lenity of the divine being.

09. This is true, but hear me out. That milk is kept upon the
high altar in which Christ is in the middle, and his mother, for respect
sake, at his right hand; for the milk represents the mother. Me.
Why, is it plain to be seen then'l 09. It is preserved in a crystal
glass. Me. Is it liquid thenl 09. What do you talk of being
liquid, when it has been put in above 1500 years ago. lt is so con·
cretcd, you would take it for beaten chalk tempered with the white of
an egg. Me. But why don't they shew it openl 09. Lest the
milk of the Virgin should be dcfiled by the kisses of men. Ma
You say very well, for I believe there aro some who put lips to it, that
