THE UNEASY WIFE. 129

ought to be provided against ; for when a spirit 01 dissension is once
sprung up, it is a difficule matter 10 bring them tc a reconciliation,
especially 11 11 ever proceeded 10 161 as to 60111010 reproachful reflec-
tious. These things that are joined together with glue are easily
pulled one from another, if they be handled roughly 66 60011 66 done ;
bnt when once they have been fast united together, and the glue 16
dry, there is nothing more firm. For this reason, all the care possible
is 10 16 1611611 that good will between man and wife be cultivated and
confirmed even in the infancy of matrimony. This is principally
affected by obsequiousness and an agreeableness 01 tempera. For
that love that is founded only upon beauty is, 101 the most part,
but shortlived.

Xe. But, prithee, tell me by what arts you brought your husband
to your humour. Era 1 will tell you 101 this end, that you may copy
61161616. Xca Well, Ι will, 11 Ican Eu. It will be very easy 1ο
do, if you will ; nor is it too late yet, 101 he is in the flower 01 his
youth, and you are but a girl, and, as I take it, have not been married
this twelvemonths yet. Xe. Yon are very right 1111. Then I will
tell you, bnt upon condition that you will not speak of it. Χ 0. Well,

Ι will not·
’ Eu. It was my first care that Ι might please my husband in every
respect, that nothing might give him offenoe. Ι diligently observed
. his inclinatione and temper, and also observed what were hia easiest
momenta, what things pleased him and what vexed him, aa they use
10 do who tame elephanta and lions, 01 such sort 01 creaturas that
cannot be mastered by downright strength. Xn And such 611 animal
hare I at horne. Ea. These that go near elephanta wear no garment
that is white, nor those who manage bulla, red; because it is found by
experience that these creatures are made fieree hy these colonrs, just
as tigers are made so raging mad by the sound 01 6 drum that they
will tear their own selves 3 and jockeys have particular sonnds and
whistles and strokings and other methods to soothe horsea that are
mettlesome. How much more does it become us to use these acts
towards 0111 husbands, with whom, whether we will or no, we must
live all our lives at bed and boardl Xa. Well, go on with what you
have be n.

Eugufflving found 0111 his humour, I accommodated myself 10
him, taking 6616 that nothing should 01161111 him Xe. How could yon
do 111611 Ea. 1166 very diligent in the care of my family, which is
the peculiar province 01 women, that nothing was neglected, and that
everything should be snitable to his temper, although it were in the
most minute things. Xa What thingsl Eu. Suppose my husband
peculiarly fancied anch a dish 01 meat, or liked it dressed after anch a
manner, or if he liked his bed made after such or such 6 manner.
Ka. But how could you humour one who was neverat home, or was

druna Have patience, I was coming 10 that point If at any time

my husband seemed 10 be melancholy and did not much care for
talking, I did 1101 laugh and put on a gay humour 66 60616 women are
used to d0; but I put on a grave demnre countenance as well as he.
For aa 6 loolringglass, if it be a true one, represents the face of the
person that looks into it, 60 a wife ought 10 1161116 herself to the temper
