to and fro, like a ship tossed by the waves, being without a rudder 3
others were supporting one so drunk he could netgo, and hardly able
to stand themselves; others fell down, and could scarce get up again ;

some were crowned with leaves of oak. Fi. Vine leaves and wands
would have befittcd them better. Bu. The senior of them, acting the
part of Silonus, was carried like a pack upon men’s shoulders, after the
manner they carry a dead corpse, with his feet foremost, but with his
face downwards, lest he should be choked with his own vomit, vomit-
ing plentifully down the heels of those that carried hindmost ; and as
to the beurere, there was not a sober man amongst them. They went
along laughing, but after such a manner that you might peroeive they
had lost their senses. In short, they were all mady and in this pickle
they made a cavalcade into the city in the day-time Fi. How came
they to be all so madl Bu. You must know, in the next town there
was wine sold something cheaper than in the city, so a parcel of boon
companions went thither, that they might attain the greater degree of
madness for the leesor sum of money 3 but though, indeed, they did
spend the less money, they got the more msduess. If these men had
but tested an egg, they would have been hauled to prison as if they had
committed parricide ; when, besides their neglecting divine service and
evening prayers upon so sacred a day, so much intemperance was not
only committed with impunity, but nobody eeemed to be so much as
displeased at it.

Fi. But that you may not wonder so much at that, in the midst of
the cities, and in alehouses next to the churches, upon the most solemn
holidays, there was drinking, singing‚ daneing, fighting, with such a
noise and tumult, that divine service could not be performed, nor one
word heard that the parson said 3 but if the same men had set a stitch
in a ahoe, or eat pork on a Friday, they would have been severely
handled. Though the Lord’s day was instituted chiefly for this end,
that they might be at leisure to attend to the doctrino of the gospel;
and therefore it was forbid to mend shoes, that they might have leisure
to trim their souls. But is not this a strange perverting of judgmentl
Bo. A prodigious one.

Fi. Whereas there are two things in the ordering a fast-the one
abstinence from meat, and the other the choise of it—there is scaros
anybody ignorant that the first is either a divine command, or very
near it ; but the other not only human, but also in a manner opposite
to the apostles’ real doctrine. However we excuse it, newertheless, by
a preposterous judgment in common, it is no crime to cat a supper, but
to tastc a bit of meat that is forbidden by man, but permitted by (lod,
and also by the apostles, this is a capital crime. Faets, though itis
not certain they were commanded by the apostles, yet they are recom-
mended in their examples and epistles. But the forbidding the eating
of meets that (lod has made to be oaten with thanksgiving, if we were
to defend that before st. Paul as a judge, to what shifts should we bs
drivenl And yet, almost all the world over, men eat plentifully, and
nobody is offended at it ; but if a sick man tacte abit of a clrioken, the
whole Christian religion is in danger. In Englend the common
people have a supper every other day, in Laut time, and nobody
wonders at it; but if a man at death's door in' a fever should
sup a little chicken broth, it is accouuted a crime worse than sacrilege.
