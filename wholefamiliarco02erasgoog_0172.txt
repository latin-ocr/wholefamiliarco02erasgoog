THE Ponticas RANQUBT. 165

double sense, either that the age itself might know something, or that
somebody might know the age. But this is an easier translation ol it

into αἰῶνα οι· κόσμον, than into γρᾶμματα. For it is absurd to say that
letters know anything3 but it is no absurdity to say, something is
known to our age, or that any one knows his age⁸¹ And a little atter,
where he propounds an ambiguity in the nocent, the translator does
not stick to put Virgil’s words instead of Homer’s‚ when there was the
same necessity in that example, gutheard dhas esse, ltoc cst, what thou
sayest is, it is. Aristotle out of Homer says, oh καταπύθεται ὄμζρῳ.

arjos computrescit placid, by whose rain it pntrefies ; but ii οὔ be acuted
and exile, it sounds aon computrescit placid, it does not putrefy with
rain; and this indeed is taken out os the Iliad ψ. Another is, διδόμεν

δὲ ol εὖχος dufoliet: the acoent being placed upon the last syllable “

but one signifies, grant to him; but placed upon the first syllable
δίδομεν, significa, we mut But the poet did not think Jupiter said,
we grant ,to him 3 but commands the dream itself to grant him to
whom it is sent to obtain his, desire. For διδόμεν is used sordiditatis.
For these two ol Homer these two are added out os our poeta, as that
out of the Odes oi Horace:

Me tuo longas pereunte noctes,
Lydia dormis,

Foris the acoent be on me being short, and ta be pronounced short, it
is one word, acetum that is hmo, 1 am afraid3 although this ambiguity
lies not in the accent only, but also arises from the composition.
They have brought another example out of Virgil:

Heu! quia nam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi

Although here also the ambiguity lies in the composition. Hs
Leonard‚ these things are indeed niceties worthy to be known 3 but in
the meantime, I arn afraid our entertainment should seem rather a
sophistical one than a poetical one. At another time, if you plesse,
we will hunt niceties and criticisms ior a whole day together. Le.

Hi. Where is my Mousel Mea. Here heis. Hi. Bid Margaret
bring up the sweetmeats. Mota Igo, sir. Hi. What! do you come
again empty-handedl Mota She says she never thought of any
sweetmeats, and that you have sat long enough already. Hi. Iam
afraid, if we should philosophiae any longer she will oome and over·
throw the table, as Xantippe did to Socrates ; therefore it is better for
us to take our sweetmeats in the garden ; and there we may welk and
talk freely, and let every one gather what fruit he likes best off os the
trees. Graan. We like your motion very well. Hs There is a little

spnn‘gaswffitgr 1111118111 yffi& that your garden is nester than your

hall. Hi. Because I spend most of my time here. Ii you like any·

thing that is here, do not spare whatever you find. And now if you

think you have walked enough, what if we should sit down together
