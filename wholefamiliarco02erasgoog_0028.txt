FORMS OF SALUTATION.

Ar res Frnsr Meamne—A certain person teuchos, and not
without reason, that we should salute freely. For a courteous and
b'nd salutetion ostentimes engages friendship, und mconciles persons
at varianae, and does undoubtedly nourish aud increase a mutual
aenevolence. There are, indeed, some persons that are such churls,
md of so clownish a disposition, that if you salute them, they will
carcely salute you again. But this vice is in some persons rather the
rffect of their education, than their natural disposition.

ο It is a picce ol civility to salute those that come in your way 5
either such as come to us, or those that we go to spealr with. And in
ure manner such as are about any sort ol work, either at supper, or
bat yona, or hiccup, or sneeze, or cough But it is' the part of a man
hatis civil evento an extreme, to salute oue that belches or breaks
vind buckward. But he is uncivilly civil that salutes one that is
naking water or easing nature. ¹

God save you, father; God save you, little mether; God save you,
mother, God seve you, my worthy master, God save you heartily,
mole; God save you, sweet cousin.

Itis courteous to make use of a title of relation or affinity, unless
uben it carries something of a reflection along with it, then indeed it
*better not to use such titles, though proper, but rather some that

more engaging, as when we call a mother-in-law, mother ; a son-

-law, son; a father-in-law, father 5 a sister's husband, brother 5 s

ther's wife, sister. And the same we should do in titles, either of

e or offioe. For it will be more accepts-hle to salute an ancient man
, the name of father or venerable sir, than by the „surname of age 5
llthough in ancient times they used to make use ol ὧγέρον as an
honaurable title. God save you, lieutenant 5 God save you, captain 5
but not, God save you, hoeier or shoemaher. God save you, youth, or
