001 modern gemes do, so that it 10 much less 11113110 10111001101110
study hard than to play. Qu. Prithee, pull out 1110100101 the tali,
11101110 may 11300 experiment with them. 01. But we have 00
101101 001 box to throw them 10. Qu. Why, this table will do well
enough to try any experiment with them3 or this oup, or cap, will
supply the place of a 101101. Oh. N ay, hustling them 10 the palm 01
000’0 hand may do well enough. A throw 0110001 10100 up the supine
1000 than the prone 1000, and the prone 1000 0110001 than a siae or 00

ch Why, 11 300 will, both 01 110 shall lay down, 0011 neither 01 us take
up 3 and he that throws four 1111101001 spots shall take up all. Qu.
What if we throw upper, 01001101, blankl Oa. That 1111011111οΙ1 go
101 nothing, 00110111101 you shall throw 03010011 will 1011011 Qu.
Ihad rather the other should take the cast. Ch Now down with
your money. Qu. Let us play 101 nothing. Ol. Would you learn

000 that knows nothing 01 the gamo to play with 0 3010θο101. 011.
Well, but the hope 01 winning and the 100101 100103 will make you
mind your game the better. Qu. How 100011011οΙ1 we play 1011
Ch. If you 110100 101011 10 301 an estate quickly let 00 play 101 100
0101100 Qu. Iwish I had them to lay down. But it is the safer
way to grow rieh gradually. See here is 0 whole halfpenny.

Ch. Well, come on, we will add a little to a little, as Hesiod
advises, and this will in time 010110 0 10130 heap. Shahe them 0011
throw away. A good beginning: you have thrown 00 0003 103 down
your money, and 00100110130 you 01000 the losing 01110. (1110 010
the tali. Qu. That 10 0 better beginning, tharsis three 0000 3 lay
down. Ch. Fortuna is layinga trap 101 30113 threw away, but 11110110
them first. Oh, good man! you have got nothing 01011,1110101000
upper blank and 00 under one. It is my throw, give metha tali.
Qu. Well done again, I see three 0000. oh. Well, do 001 1001100 your
chiokens before they be hatehed. Well, fortune has (1 mind to makes

he that threw 0 size took up nothing, but 1110011101 laid down. Qu.
But what 11 110 threw doubletsl Oh. Then the other laid down so
many pisces: and when 111010 was a 30011 heap of money down, he that
threw venus took up 011 3 and you may add this, 11 you will, that he

that well enough. But how many venus’s will you 100110 upl 012.
Why, three, if 300 will3 and 01101 that you may melre a new bargain,
