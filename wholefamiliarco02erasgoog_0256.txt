THE narramus Placentinos. 249

When this hysteroprotos saw me so religiously transported with
that small present, thinking I deserved to have things os mester
moment imparted to me, he asked me if I had seen the Virgin's secreta.
That word startled me a little, but I durst not ask him what he meant ,
by the Virgin’s secreta, for in matters so sacred there is danger in a slip
oi the tongue. 1 told him Ι had not seen them, but I had a very great
desire to see them, Then I am conducted in as one in an ecstacy. A
wax taper or two was lighted, and a little image was shewn me that
made no extraordinary figure, neither for magnitude, matter, nor work-
manship, but of extraordinary virtue. Me. Bulk has no great matter
in it es to the doing of miracles. I have seen st. Ohristopher at Paris,
not him of a cartload or of the size of a colossus, but rather of a large ⁸
mountain; but I never heard he was famous for doing miracles. 09.
At the feet of the Virgin there is a jeuel that neither the Latius nor
Greeks have yet given a name to. The French have given it a name
from a toad, because it has the resemblance oi a toad in it so lively that
no art can match it. And that which is the more miraculous is that it
is a very small stone, and the image does not stand out of it, but is
included in the very body of the stone, and may bc seen through it.

Me. Perhaps they may fancy they see the likeness of a toad cut in
it, as some fancy they see that of an eagle in the stalk of a brake or
seru 3 and as boys, who see everything in the clouds, as dragous
breathing out lire, burning mountains, and armed men fighting. Oq.
Nay, that you may be thoroughly satisfied in the matter, no living
x toad ever shewed itself more plainly than that is expressed there
Me. I have been hearing your stories all this while, but Ι would have
you find out somebody else to give credit to your story oi the toad.
Oy. Ι do notat all wonder, Menedemus, that you are so incredulous 3
I should not have believed it mysels if the whole tribe of divines had
asserted it, unless Ι had seen it with these eyes-I say beheld it with
these very eyes, and had experienced the truth of iu But methinks
you seem not to be curicus enough upon these natural rarities. Mc.
Why sol what, because Ι will not believe that asses fly.

09. But do you not observe how nature sporta herself in imitating
the shapes and colours of everything in other things, ’hut especially in
hillidii} abluti? kltuttfilnktt{dinitidat
· force us to a belief of theml Prithee, tell me, would yon ever have
believed without seeing it with your eyes that steel could have been
drawn by the loadstone without touching it, orbe driven away from it
without being touched by itl Me. No, indeed, Ι never should,
although ten Aristotles had taken their oaths of the truth of it

Oq. Well, then, do not say everything is a fable that has not fallen
within the comps-ss ol your experience. We find the figure of a holt
in a thunder-stone, fire in the carbuncle, the figure of hail and the
coldness ol it in the hail-stone, nay, even though you throw it into the
midst of the lire ; the deep and transparent waves of the sea in the
emerald3 the carcinias imitates the figure of a seacrab, the echites of
a viper, the neantes os a gilt head, the theracites of· a hawk, the gera·
nites shews you the figured neck of a crans, the aegophthalmus shews
the eye of agoni, and some shew that of a hog, and another three
human eyes together 3 the lycophthalmus points you¹ out the eye oia
