retending 10 10 wonderfully busy about the bellows and the ceals,
binus inquired of him whether the business went forwardl At
first he made 00 answer, but 01 last he urging 110 question, he made
, him answer, As all great works do, the greatest difficulty 01 which is
in catering upon them. He pretended he had made a mistake in
buying the ceals, for he had bought oaken ones when they should have
been beechen or fir oues. There was a hundred crowns gone, and he
did 001 spara 10 go to gaming again briskly.

Upon giving him new cash he geta new ceals, and then the
business is begun again with more resolution than before, just 00

repair it by bravery. When the laboratory had been kept hot for
some months, and the gelden fruit was expected, and there was not a
grain 01 gold in the vessel (for the chemist had spent 011 1101 100), another
pretence was found out-that the glasses they used were not rightly
tempered, for, as every block will 001 make 0 mereury, so gold will not

been spent, by so much the loather he was 10 give it over, just 00 11 10
with gumesters, as if it were 001 101100 10 1000 some than all. Lu.
Very true. Pa. The chemist swore he was never 00 cheated since

. he was born before, but now having found out his mistake, he could

proceed with all the security in the world, and fetch up 1101 1000 with
great interest. The glasses being changed, 110 10100010ογ 10 furnished

00 more successfully if he sent 0 present 01 crowns 10 110 Virgin Mary,
that you know 10 worshipped at Paris,for 11 was an holy 001, and
in order 10 have it carried on successfully it needed the favour 01
110 saints. ·
Balbinus liked 1110 advice wonderfully well, being 0 very picus
man, that never let a day pass but 10 performed some 001 01 devotion
or 01100. Τ10 operator undertakes 110 religione pilgrimage, but

saying the horary prayers, for nothing would svrcceed if these were
