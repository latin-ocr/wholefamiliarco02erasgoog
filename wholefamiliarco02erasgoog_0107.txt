100 FAMILIAR consodales

away these things and bring up the rest. You 000 1101 the affluence,
but tbe straitness 01 my fortune. This 10 the product 01 my gardens
you have seen 3 don’t spere, if you like anytbing. 11. There is so
great a variety, it does a man good to look upon it lla. Tbat you
may 1101 altogether despise my thriftiness, this dish would have cheered
up the 11001101 old Hylarion, the evangelical monk, with a hundred
111010 011110 1011011011ιο monks 01 that aga. But Paul and Anthony
would have lived a mouth upon it. Ta. Yes, and prince Peter too, I
fancy, would have leaped at it, when be lodged at Simon the tanner's.
Ea. Yes, and Paul too, Ibelieve, when hy reason 01 poverty be sat
up at nighte to make 101110. Τι’. How much do we owe to the good-
ness of God! But yet,I had rather suffer hunger with Peter and
Paul, upon condition that what Ι wanted 101 my body might be made
up by the satisfaction 01 my mind.

Ea. Let us learn 01 St. Paul both how to abound and how to
suffer want. When we want, let us praise God that He has afforded
us 1110110110 exorciso our frugality and patience upon. When we
abound, let us be thankful 101 His munificence, who by His liberality
invites and provokes us to love Him 3 and using those things the
divine bounty has plentifully bestowed upon us with moderatiori and
temporanee, let us be mindful 01 the poor, whom God has been pleased
10 suffer to want what Hebae made abound to us, that neither side
may want an occasion 01 exercising virtue. For He bestows upon us
sufficient lor the relies 01 0111 brother’s necessity, that we may obtain
His marey, and that the poor, 011 the other hand, being refresbed by
our liberality, may give Him thanks for putting it into our bearts, and
recommend us to Him in their prayers3 and, very well remembered,
come bitber, boy, bid my wife send Gudula 00111001 the roast meat
that is left: it is a very good poor woman in the neighbourhood big
witb child, her husband is lately dead, a profuse, lazy fellow, that has
left nothing but a stock 01 children. Christ has commanded 10 give to
every one that asks 3 but 11 Ι should do 00,Ι should go a begging
myself in 0 1110111110 111110.

Eu. I suppose Christ means only such as ask for necessarias. For
to them who ask, hay, who importune, or rather extort great sums
110111 paople 1ο 1111111011 voluptuous entertainments, or, which is worse,
10 seed luxury and 11101, 11 10 cbarity to deny; nay, it is a kind 01
rapina to bestow that which we owe 10 the present necessity 01 0111

guilty 01 0 11101101 0111, who at 11 prodigious hripense either build oi
beautify monasterias or churches, when in the meantime so many living
temptes 01 Christ are ready 10 010110 101 110111 01 foed and clothing,
and are sadly afflicted with tbe want 01 other necessarias.

When I was in England, I saw St Thomas’s tomb all over
bedecked witha vast number 01 jewels 01 011 1011101100 price, besides
other rich seruitute, even to admiration3 I had rather that these
superfluities should be applied to charitabla 11000, than to be reserved

101 princes, that shall one time 01 other make a booty 01 1110111. The
holy man, I am confident, would have been better pleased 10 have his
tomb adorned with leaves and flowers.
