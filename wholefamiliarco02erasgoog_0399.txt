392 Marmara COLLOQUIES.

what horror he lcaped away, how srightened hc was, and with what
l'earfulness he looked back to see whether the tortoise followed him or
not. There was likewise another specimen: the tortoise was tied to
the monkcy’s chain that he could not avoid seeing him. It is incred-
ible how much he was tormented; he was almost dead with sear: some-
times turning his back, he would endeavour to beat 011 the tortoise
with his hindei· feet, 01 1001, he pissed and shit towards him all that
was in his belly, and with the fright fell into such a sever that we
were forced 10 101 him loose, and put him into a bath made 01 wine
and water. Jo. There was no reason that the monkey should be
afraid 01 the tortoise.

Ep. There may, perhaps, be something natural in it that we are
not acquainted with. Why 0 110001 should hate an ass is easily
accounted for; because he rubs himself against the thorus, and 0010 off
the flowers 01 the hedge where she makes her 0001;0101 she is so
affrighted 01 the sight 01 00 000, that 11 she hear him bray, though it
be a great way 011, she throws down her egga, and her young ones fall
00101 the nest for sear. But, however, she does not suffer him to pass
unrevcngerl. ιῙο. How can 0 110001 do any hurt to an 0001 Ep.
She peclrs his forebuck‚ that is galled with blows and burdens, aud the
soft part olbis nose. We may 0100 guess at the 00000 why there is 0
mutual grudge between the fox and the kite, because the iuvencus
fowl is always lying in wait to catch the fox¹s whelps3 and very likely,
'on the other hand, that the forr does the same by her young ones,
which is the cause 01 the dissensiou between the rat and the heron.
And the same reason may be given for the enmity between the little
bird called a merliu and the lox: the merlin breaks the crow's egge,
the sores persecute them, and they the soree, peelring their wheIpS,
which thc crows sceiug, jein their assistance 00 against 0 common
00010 .

illut Ι 000001 find out any reason why the swan aud the engle,
the raven and the green-bird, the rook and the owl‚ the eaglo and the
wren should hate one another, unless it hc that the latter hates the
cagle because he is called the king 01 birds. Why should an owl be
an enemy to sruall birds, a weascl to 0 crow, a turtle-dove to a candle-
fly, the ichneumon (lndiau rats) wusps to the spiders called 0101010110,
ducks to sea-gulls, the harpe 10 the buzzard-hawk, the wolf to the 11001
And besides, why should rats have an aversiou to a trce where ants
arel Why is there so irreconcilable 00 enmity between a beetle and
an eaglel for the sablo was framed from the nature 01 that animal.
Hence it is that near to Olynthus, in 0 certain place beetlcs will not
live 11 they ure brought into it. And then, again, between creatures
that liro in the water 3 what reason is there why the mullet and the
pike mutually hate one another, as the conger and the lomprey, that
guaw one another-’s tailsl The lobster has such an hatred to tho
polypus that isit chance to see it near him hc dies with sear.

On the contrary, a certain hidden affection os goodwill has united
ether creatureS, 00 1100000110 aud dorca, turtles and porreta, blaekbirds
und thrushes, erows aud herous, who mutually 000101 000 another
against the lox, the harpe and kite against the triorche, which is 0
10001 01 hawk, and a common enemy to them. The musculae, a little
flsh swimming before the whole, is a guide to him 3 nor does it appear
