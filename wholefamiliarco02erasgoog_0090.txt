ΤΗΕ RELIGIOUS BANQUET. 81

Socrates puts the case 01 1 mon’s walking alone in the fields3 although,
in my opinion, there nature 11 not dumb, but talkative enough, and
speaks to the instruction of a man that has but 1 good will and a
capacity 10 101111 What does the beautiful face of the spring do, but
proclaim the equal wisdom and goodness 01 the Creatori And how
many excellent things did Socrates in his retirement both teach his
Phaedrus and learn from himl If a man could have such pleasant
company, I confess, 110 1110 in the world could be pleasanter than 1
00111111 life.

1111 Have you a mind to make trial 01 111 If you have, come
take a dinner with 1110 1011011011 Ι have a pretty neat little country
house,a little way out 01 town, Τι’. We 110 100 many of us, we shall
eat you out of house and home. Eu. Never fear that, you are 10

figs, the pears, the apples and nuts are offered to you by the 11001
themselves ; you need but gape, and they will fall into your mouth, as
it isin the Fortunate Islands, if we may give credit to Lucian. Or, it
may he, we may get a pullet out 01 the 11011-10011, 01 so. Τ1. Upon
these terms we will be your guests, Ea. And let every man bring
his friend along with him; and then, as you now 110 four, wc shall be

that Ι shall only find meat, you are 10 bring your own sauce. Τι’.
What sauce do you mean-pepper or sugarl Eu. N0, no, something
that is chesper, but more savoury. Τ1. What is 111111 Eo. A good
stomaeh. A light supper tonight, and 1 little walk to-morrow
morning, and that you may thank my country house for. But 11
what hour do you plesse to dine atl Τ1. Α1 ten o’clock, before it
grows 100 hot. Eu. I will give orders accordingly,

Serv. Sir, the gentlemen are come. Eu. You are welcome,
gentlemen, that yon are come according to your words ; but you are
twice as welcome for coming so early, and bringing the best of company
along with you. There are some persons who are guilty of an unman-
nerly civility, in making their host wait for thern. ri. We came the
earlier that we might have time enough to view all the euriosities of
your palace 3 for we have heard that it is so admirably contrived every·
where, as that it speaks who is the master 01 it. 111. And you will
see a palace worthy 01111011 1 prince. This little nest is to me more
than 1 court, and if he may be said 10 reign that lives 11 liberty
according to his mind, Ι reign here. But Ι think it will be best, while
the wench in the kitchen provides us a salad, and it is the 0001 01 the
morning, to take a walk to see the gardens. Ti. Have you any
other besides 111111 For truly this is a wonderful neat one, and
with a pleasing aspect salutes a man at his entering in, and bids

scent3 therefore, let every one take what he likes. Don't be sparing‚
for this place lies, in a manner, common, Ι never shut it up but at
nights. Ti. St Peter keeps the gates, I perceive. Eu. I like this
porter better than the mercuries‚ centauro, and other fictitious mousters
