grow on their foreheads, and then they seem very cunning fellows, und
are more fit to rnle than to be ruled. And at last you send them away
in a condition to live merrily and die blessedly. Bc. Ι find yon can-
not keep your tongue from railing3 but have a care you do not raise
my indignatiou. If you do not sorbonn throwing your squibs at me,
I will throw them at you again ; Ι have something to hit you in the
teeth of. l't. And nothing butslanders. Bc. You poor wretch you,I
say Ι send them baok such (whether you know it or no) that they will
not striko sail to your poete for versification (that is the chief thing
you have to boast of).

ΤΙι. For number‚I confess ; but we do not so much regard the
number of verses as the goodness of them, But you, on the contrary,
only take notice of the number, and not the goodness 3 you count the
peges, but pass by the barbarisms that are in them. So they do but
hang together, that is the only thing that you regard‚ it is no matter
for the gooduess of thorn. Bo, Yon senseless creature, you make a
mighty to do about goodness; I do not think anything is so empty of
goodness as your poema ; for what are they but gilded lies, full of old
women's tnlesl Th Yon commend them sufficiently. Ba Ι com-

you do it. Bc. What, such lying ones 3 I rather ridicule thern than
praise them. vl. You praise thern against your will. Ba. How sol
Tu While thou envieusly railest st them ; for the way to displease those
that are bad is to commend thern. Ba. Great aud elaborate lies that
anybody may envy.

rt. You shew your ignorenoe ss plainly as the sun at noonday.
Unhappy wretch, you are not sensible how much you commend the
industry of those poets ογ your foolish talking, who think it unfit to
cast roses before swine in mire and dirt; and therefore they wrap up
and hide the truth in ambiguous words and enigmatical expressions,
that though all may read them, yet all may not understand them.
They read them, and go away as ignorant asif they never had seen
thern. A man of learning reads thern, and searehes into the meaning
of the words (for they are transpurcnt), and finds that under them is
couched a vast treasure of wholesome truth that the other passed over
unobserved. Bo. Yery fine, very fine; u comical piece of roguery‚ to

pray, which do you look upon to be the best, to pick up jewels out of
dung, or to admire them set in goldl Ba The last is the best.

Th. You mean to yourself, and so it is. As for you, if there is
any trnth in a poem, you obscure it so with trifling words, that it '
rather makes it look (lim, than gives it a lustro. On the contrary, we
(not as you reproachfully say) do not corrupt thetruth by an eleganoy
of words; but wc put a lustre upon it, as when a jewel is set in gold.
We do not take the lustre from it, but add to it ; we do not make it
more dark, but shine the brighter. And lastof all, this we do, we
labour that that truth, which is of its own nature profitable, be made

ι more grateful by industry. As for your partisans, they being ignorant
of these things, reproach, carp at, and are envious at them. If they
were wise,how much more would they cry me up-I have stoppcd your
