THE CANONIZATION OF JOHN REUCLIN. 111

instant that the holy man had the vision, they unanimously gave
thanks to ch that abundantly rewards good men for their good decd's-T]

Po. What have we to do but ιο set down this holy man’s name
in the calendar of saintsl Br. I should have done that if the Fran-
ciscan had seen nothing at all of this, and in gold letters too,I will

assurc you, next to St. J erome himself. Po. And let me die if Ι don't ·

put him down in my book so too. Br. And besides that, I will set
him in gold in my little chapel, among the choicest of my saints. Po.
And ifI had afortune to my mind,I would have him in diamonds.
Br. He shall stand in my library th ry next ιο St. J erome. Po.
And Ι will have him in mine too. &a If they were grateful, every
one who loves learning and languages, especially the holy tongues,
would do so ιοο. Ρο. Truly it is no more than he deserves. But
have not you some scruple upon your mind, inasmuch as heis not yet
canonised by the authority of the bishop cf Romel Br. Why, pray,
who canonised (for that is the wordp St. J eromel who canonised St.
Paul, or the Virgin Maryl Pray tel me, whose memory is most sacred
among all good menl These that by their eminent piety, and the
monuments of their learning and good life, have entitled themselves to
the veneration of all men 3 or Catherine of Sien, that was sainted by
Pius the Second, in favour of the order and the cityl Po. You say
· true; that is the right worship that by the will of Heaven ‘s paid ιο
the merits of the dead, whose benefits are always sensiblyffl

Br. And can you then deplere the death of this manl lf long
lise be a blessing he enjoyed it. He bas left behind him immortal
monuments of his virtue, and by his good works consecrated his name
to immortality. He is now in heaven, cut of the reach of missortunes,
conversing with St. Jerome himself. Po. But he suffered a great
deal though in his life. Br. But yet St. Jerome suffered more. Itis
a blessing to be perseouted by wicked meu for being good. Po. l
confess so ς and St. J erome suffered many unworthy things from the
worst of men for the best of deeds.

Br. That which Satan did formerly by the Scribes and Pharisees
against the Lord J esus, he oontinues still to do by pharisaical men
against good men, who bave deserved well from the world by their
studies. He now reaps the blessed harvest of the seed he bas been
sowing. In the meantime it will be our duty to preserve his memory
sacred, to honour his name, and ιο address him often in some such
manner as follows: Oholy soul, be thou propitious to languages, and
to those that cultivate them: favour the holy tongues, and destroy
evil tongues that are infected with the poison of hell. Po. Ι will do
it myself, and earnestly persuade all my friends to do it. 1 make no
question but there will be those that will desire to have some little
form of prayer, according to custcm, ιο celebrate the memory of this
most holy hero. Br. Dc you mean that which they call a collectl
Po. Yes. Br. Ihave one ready that Ι provided before his death.

Po. I ray let us hear it.

gi. “0 God, that art the lover of mankind, that hast by thy chosen
se t, John Reuclin, renewed to mankind the gift of tongues, by
which thy Holy Spirit from above did formerly furnish the apostles
for their preacbing the gospel ; grant that all people may everywhere,
in all languages, preach the glory of thy Son desua christ, to the con·
