1111 PREFACE.

unjustly they do this will appear more evidently when I 011011 have
shewn the great profitableness of some Colloquies: to emit 00 many
sentences intermixed with jests; so many pleasant storias, and the
naturas 0100 many things worthy to be taken notice 01.

In the Colloquy concerning Visiting 01 Holy Places, the super·
stitious and immoderate affection 0100101010011011011, who think 1110110
the chielest piety 10 have visited Jerusalem ; and thither do old bishops ,
111 0101 so great tracta 01 land and sea, leaving their charge, which
'they should rather have taken care 01. Thither also do princes run,
leaving their 101111100 and their dominions Thither do husbands run,
leaving their wives and children 01 home, whose manners and chastity
it 11010 necessary 10 have been guarded by them. Thither do young
men and women run, with 1110 hazard 01 their manners and integrity.
And some go the second time, ay, do nothing else all their lifelong ;
and in the meantime 1110 pretence 01 religion is made the excuse 101
their superstition, inconstancy‚ folly, and rashness; and he that 11000110
his family oontrary 10 the doctrine 01 St. Paul bears away 1110 bell 101
sanctimony, and thinks himself completely religious. Paul (1 Tim. v.
8) boldly says, “But if any provide not 101 his own, and especially
those 01 his own house, he hath (101110111110101111,011111011010011101
an infidel.'’ And yet Paul in this place seems to speak 01 widows that
neglect their children and grandchildren, and that under pretence 01
religion, while they give themselves up 10 the service 011110 ohurch.
What would he say 01 husbands who leave their tender children and '

A certain great man took 0 resolution 10 pay a visit to Jerusalem be
1010 hc died,with a religious intent, indeed, but not well advised. Having
set in order the affairs 01 hia possessione, he committed the caro and
oustody 01 his lady, who was big with child, of his towns and castles,
to an archhishop as to a 1011101. Αο 0001 00 the news arrived that the
man was dead in his pilgrimage‚ the archbiahop, instead 01 001113 the
part 01 0 father, played the robber, seized all the dead man’s possessione,
and besieged a strong, welldelended castle, into which the lady, great
with child, had fled3 and 110111 taken it by storin, 1001 any one should
survive who might revenge thelreinous fact, the lady great with child,
together with her infant, was run through and died. Would it 101
have been a picus daed to have dissuaded 11110 man 11011 00 dangerous
and unneceasary a journeyl How many examples 01 this kind there
are to bo found, I 10010 others to judge. In the meantime, 10 say
nothing 01 the charges, which, though Ι 31011 they be not entirely lost,
yet there is no wiso man but will 0011000 that they might have boen
laid out to 101 better purpose. But then, as 101110 religion 01 making
such visits, St. J aromo commende Hilarion 11 that, though he was a
native 01 Ρο1001110 and dwelt 11 Ρο1001110, yet he never went to see
Jerusalem, though it was 00 1001, but 0100, 1001110 might seem 10
despise holy places 11 Hilarion was deservedly commended because,
being so 1000110 10111010 3011310 visit Jerusalem, lest he should seem
to shut up God in 0 1011011 compass, and went thither but once, and
