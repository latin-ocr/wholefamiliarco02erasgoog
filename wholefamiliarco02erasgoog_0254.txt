THE RELIGIOUS Priuernate, Ι 247

Virgin that is worshipped at Paris in that noble ohurch that has the
river Seine on each side of it, as il itself gave place in reverence to the

divinity ol the Virgin. To sum up the matter in few words, William ⁸·

was buried;· the other rides post, but he falla siclt by the way, and
thinking himself past recovery, he delivers the milk to an Englishman
11181811181118181188-118881181, makinghim take e solemn oath that he
would perform that which he himself was to have done. The one dies,
the other· takes it and puts it upon the altar in the presence 81811 the
canons of the place, those that at that time were called regulare, as they
are yet at St. (lenoveve. He obtained half this milk of them and
carried it into England,' and made a present of it to this beyond-sea
place, his mind being moved thereunto by a divine impulse. Me.
Truly this story hange very handsomely together.

09. Nay, further, that there might not be left the least room to
doubt, the very names of the bishops were set down that were author-
ised to grant releases and indulgenoes to such as should come to aee the
milk according to the power· to them given, but not without some
donation or· another. aa. And how sar did that power-extendi 09.
To forty days. Me. But are there days in purgatoryl 09. For
certain there is time there. Me. But when they have disposed of this
stock of forty days have they no more to bestowl 09. No 3 for there
ever and anon arises something for them to bestow, and it ie in this
quite otherwise than it is with the tub ol the Danaides ; for though that
ie continually filling, it is always empty; hut in this, though you are
continually drawing out, there is never the less in the vessel. Me.
But if the remission of forty days were given to a hundred thousand
men would every one have so muehl Oq. Yon, somuoh. Me. And
suppose that they that have received forty days in the morning should ask
for sorty days more at night, would they have wherewithal to give 11181111
09. Υ88, 1811 times over· in an hour. Me. Iwish 1 had such a cabinet
at home. Iwould not wish for above three grosts if they might be
doubled and tripled after that manner. 09. You might as well have
wished to be all turned into gold yourself, and as soon have had what
you wished fon

But 1ο return to my story, there was one argument added by a man
of great piety and candour, which is, that though the Virgiu’s milk,
which is shown in many other places, is indeed venerable enough in that
it was scraped off from stonee, yet this was more venerable than all
the rest, because this was saved as it flowed from the Virgin's breast
without touohing the ground. Me. But how does that appearl 09.
Oh, the nun at Constantinople that gave it said so. Ma It may be
she hedit of St. Bernard. 09. Ι believe she had. Me. He, when
he was very old, had the happiness to toste milk from the same nipple
which the child Jeaus sucked, whence I wonder-he was not rather
called Lactifluous than Mellifluous. But how is that called the Virgin's
milk that did not flow from her breastsl 09. That did flow from 1111·
breasts, but dropping upon the stone she sat upon while she was giving

suck it concreted‚ and was afterwards by Providence 8ο multiplied. .

Me. Right. Goon.
09. These things being over, we were just upon 1118 point of going

away, but walking about and looking round us to 888 if there wan any.
thing worth taking notice of, the ohapel officere come to 1181131111ι
