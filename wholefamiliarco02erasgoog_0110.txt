thing changed, and the person the 881118. And it is so spoken 81 A,
that it is the same 8888 if you should say the same thing 81 B 3 88 thus,

118. In truth, you have very artificially solved this problem: no
mathematioian could have demonstrated it better upon a 81818.

Sepla That which is the greatest difficulty to 1118 18 1118-,11181 we
are forbidden 18 take thought 181 1811181181, when yet Paul himself
wronght with his own hands 181 bread, and sharply rebukes lazy
people and those that live upon other men’s labour, exhorting them
to take paine, and get their living by their fingers' ends, that they may
have wherewith to relieve others in their necessities Are not they
holy and warrantable labours by which a poor husband provides 181
his 11881 wife and childrenl

11 This is 8 question which, in my opinion, may be resolved
several ways. First 81811, this 18111 had 8 particular respect to those
times. The apostles being dispersed 181 and wide 181 the preaching 81
the gospel, all solicitous care 1818 maintenanoe was 18 be thrown
881118, 11 being 18 be supplied otherwise, having 1181 18181118 18 381 their
living by their labour, and especially they having no way 81 getting
it but by fishing. But now the world 18 881118 18 another pass, and
we all 1818 18 1118 81 ease, and shun painstaking. Another 118181

to the tgemyier 81 men in common, who 818 anxious 181 nothing 111811
111811 getting 8 livelihood, that setting all other things 881118, this is
the only thing they mind. And our Saviour 11888 in 8 manner intimate
the 881118 Η11118811, when He says “that 8118 111811 cannot serve two
masters;” 181 he that wholly gives himself up 18 anytbing is 8
servant to it Now He would have the propagation 81 the gospel be
8111811181, 11111181 not 81181111 care; 181 Η8 8818, “ Seek ye first the
kingdom 8111881811,81111 these things shall be added 111118 1811.” Η8
(18881818818881181111,1111188811 first. And besides, I take the word
tomorrow to be hyperbolical, and in that 8131111188 8111118 to come, a
great while hence-it being the custom 81 the misere 81 this world 18
be anxionely soraping together, and laying up 181 posterity.

En. We allow 81 18111 interpretation ; but what does He mean
when He says, “Be not solicitous 181 18111 1118, what you shall 8811” The
body 18 clothed, but the soul 11888 1181 eat rt. By anima is meant
life, which cannot subsist without meat (8118 in danger if you take
away its food); but itis not 88 11 you take away the garment, which
is more 181 1118118811 than necessity. 1181818811 is 181881183811811811,
he 118881181 die presently; but want 81 1881118 certain death. Ea. Ι
do not well understand how this sentence agrees with that which
follows ι “ 18 nottho 1118 111818 111811 meat, and the body than raiment 1”
For 11 1118 be 88 precious, we ought to 18118 the more aare 81 it. ri.
This argument 11888 rather increase our solicitousness than 1888811 11.

1118 Β111 thisis none 81 8111 Saviour's meaning, who by this
11111111511111111111111 silletensis
He will also bestow upon 118 what is 1888 valuable. He that has giveri
