being pretty well staid, they bring roast meat or stewed fish, which is ·
not to be at all contemned3 but this they are sparing of, and take it
away again quiekly. This is the manner they order the entertainment‚
as comedians do, who intermingle danaes among their soenes, so do
they their ehops and soups by turns. But they take care that the last
aot shall be the best. Will. This is the part of a good poet.

Bert. And it would be a heincus offence if, in the meantime, any
body should say, take away this dish, there 10 nobody 0010. You must

011001 youl And by and by some better wine is brought. And they
like those best that drink most, though he that drinks most pays no
more than he that drinks least. Wilc. A strange temper of the
nation! Bert. Γ1311010010 some of them that drink twice as much
wine as they pay for their ordinary. But before Ι leave this enter-
tainment, it is wonderful what 0 110100 and chattering there is when
once they come to be warm with wine. In short, it deafcns a man.
They oftentimes bring in a mixture 01 mimica, which these people very
much delight i'n, though they are a detestable sort of men. There is
such a singing, prating, bawliug, jumping, and knocking, that you
· would think the stove were falling upon your head, and that one man
cannot hear another speak. And this they think is a pleasant way of
living, and there you must sit in spite of your heart till near midnight.

11111. Make an end 01 your meal now, 101 I myself aar tired with
such 0 tedicus one. Bert. Well, I will. At length the cheese is
taken away, which scarcely plcases them, except it be rotten and full
01 maggots. Thea the old bearded fellow comes again with a trencher
and many circlos and semi-eireles drawn upon it with chalk 3 this he
lays down upon the table with a grim countenance and without speak-
ing. You would say he was some Charon They that understand 1110

11111. This 10 0 frank sort of men you are speaking 01.

Bert. If any one 10 weary with his journey, and desires to go to
bed as soon as he has supped, he is bid to stay till the 1001 go too.
Wv'll. This seems to me to be Plato’s city. Bert. Thea every one 10
