that such jedes had been kept for cheats, that you would take by their
’ looks to be very good horses, but were‘worth nothing for service. Ι
says to myself presently, Iam caught. But when 1 come home again
Ι will shew him trick for trick.

Aa. But what did you do in this cose, being a horseman without 8
horscl Ph. Idid what Ι was obliged to do. Iturned into the next
village, and there Ι set my horse up privately with an acquaintance,
and hired another and prosecuted my Journey, aud when I came back
Ι returned my hired horse, and finding my own in very good cassand
thoroughly rested,l mounted his back and rode back to the horse-
courser‚ desiring him to set him up for a few days till I called for him
again. He asked me how well he carried me. Iswore by all that was
good that Ι never bestrid a better nug in my life, that he flew rather
than walked, nor never tired the least in the world in all so long 8
Journey, nor was a hair the leaner for it. I having made him believe
that these things were true, he thought with himself he had been
mistalren in this horse ; and therefore, before Ι went away, he asked
me if Ι would sell the horse. I refused at first, because if Ι should have
occasion to go such another journey, I should not easily get the fellow
of him ; but, however, Ι value nothing so much but I would sell it, if
I could have a good price for it, although anybody had a mind to buy
myself. Aa. This was fighting a man with his own weapons. Pl.
In short, he would not let me go away before Ι had set a price upon
him. I rated him at a great deal more than he eost me.

Being goue,I got an acquaintance to act for me, and gave him
instructions how to behave himself. He goes to the house and calls
for the horse-ccurser, telling him that he had occasion for a very good,
and a very hardy nag. The horse-ccurscr shews him a great many
horses, still commending the worst most ofall; but says not a word of that
horse he had sold me, verily believing he was such as [had represented
him. My friend presently asked whether that was not to be sold-for
Ihad given him a description of tho horse and the place where he
stood. The horso-courser at first made no answer but commended
the rest very highly. The gentleman likcd the other horscs pretty
well, but always treated about that very horso. At last thinks the
horse-courser with himself, Ι have certainly been out in my judgment
as to this horse, if this stranger could presently pick this horse out of
so many. He insisting upon it, He may be sold, says he, but it may
be you will be fiightened at the price. The price, says he, isa case of
nc great importunae, if the goodness of the thing be answerable. Tell
me the price. ·He told him something more than Ι had sethim at to
him, getting the overplus to himself. At last the price was agreed on,
and a good large earnest was given, a ducat of gold to bind the bargain.
The purchaser gives the ostler a groat, orders him to give his horse
some corn, and he would come by and by and feteh him.

As soon as ever Ι heard the bargain was made sc firmly that it could
not be undone again, 1 go immediately, booted and spurred, to the
horsecourser, and being out of brcath calls for my horse. He comes
and asks what I wanted. Saye I, (lot my horse ready presently, for Ι
must be gone this moment upon an extraordinary affair. But, says
he, you bid me keep the horse a few days. That is true, said l, but
this business has happened unexpectedly, and itis the king‘s business,
