'trstly, although they moy seem to human sense absurd or unjust.

hen I animadvert on His goodness 1 see nothing in myself that I do
not owe to free grace, and Ithinlr there is no sin so greum but He is
willing to forgive to a true peniteat, nor nothing but what He will
freely bestow on him that asks infaith. Aac Dost thou think that it
is sufficient for thee to believe Him to be sol Ba. By no means.
But with a sincere affection I put my whole trust and confidenee in
Him alone, detesting Satan, and all idolatry, and magic arts. I
worship Him alone, preferring nothing ,before Him, nor equalling
nothing with Him, neither angel, nor my parents, nor children, nor
wife, nor prince, nor riches, nor honours, nor pleasures3 being ready to
lay down my life if He call for it, being assured that he cannot
possibly perish who commits himself wholly to Him.

Aa. What, then, dost thou worship nothing, fear nothing, love
nothing but God alonel Ba. lf I reverence anything, fear anything,
or love anything, it is for His sake Ι love it, fear it, and reverence it;
referring all things to His glory, always giving thanks to Him for
whatsoever happens, whether prosperoue or adverse, life or death.
Aa. In truth your confession is very sound so far. What do you
think concerning the second personi Ba. Examine me.

Aac Dost thou believe Jeeus was God and mant Bc. Yes.

especial manner belongeth to the Father, who is absolutely the original
of all things, and the fountain even of the Godhead itself Lord is the
nanis of a redeemer and deliverer, although the Father also redeemed
us by His Son, and the Son is God, but of God the Father. But the
Father only is from none, and obtains the first place among the divine

pe Aa. Then, dost thou put thy confidence in Jesusl Bu Why
‚ nott Au. But the prophet calls him accursed who puts his trust in
man. Bo. But to this Man alone bath all the power in heaven and
earth been given, that at His name every knee should bow, both of
things in heaven, things in earth, and things under the earth.
