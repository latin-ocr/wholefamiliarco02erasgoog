178 FAMILIAB OOLLOQUJES.

Iaffront no man, I carry a cheerful oountenance to all, Ι salute and
resaluta affably, Ι find no fault with what any man purposes to do or
does Ido ιιοι prefer myself before other people, I let every one enjoy
his opinion; what Ι would have kept as a secret I tell to nobody. I
never am curicus to pry into the privacies of other men. If I happen
ιο οοιιιο ιο the knowledge of anything, Ι never blab it. As for absent
ffisona Ieither say nothing at tall of them, or speak of them with

dness and civility Great part of the quainels that ariae between
men come from the intemperance of the tongue. Ι naver breed
quarrels or heighten them; but wherever opportunity happens, I
either moderate them or pirt an end ιο them. By these methods
Ι have hitherto kept clear of envy, and have maintained the affectione
of my fellow- citizens.

Ρο. Did you not find a single life irkaome to youl GL Nothing
happened ιο me in the whole course of my life more afflicting than the

· death of my wife, and I could have passionately wished that we might

have grown old together, and'might have enjoyed the comfort of the
common bleasing, our children. But since Providence saw it meet it
should ιο otherwise, Ι judged that it was best for us both, and there
fore did not think there was cause for me to affiict myself with grief,
that would do no good neither to me nor the deceased. Po. What,
had you never an inclination to marry again, especially the first having
been so happy a match ιο youl Gt. Ι had an inclination so to do;
but as 1 married for the sake of children, so for the sake of my children
I did not marry again Po. But it is a mise1able case to lie alone
whole nights without a hedfellow.

Gt. Nothing is hard ιο a willing mind. And then do but consider
the benefits of a single life. There are some people in the world who
will ιο for making the worst of everything3 such a ons Crates seemed
to be, or an epigram under his name, summing up the evils of human
life. And the resolution is thia, that it is best not to be born at all.
N ow Metrodorus pleases me a great deal better, who picks οιιι what is
good in it, this makes life the pleasanter. And Ι brought my mind to
that temperes indifference never to have a violent aversion or fondness
for anything. And by this it comes to pass, that if any good fortune
happens to ma, Ι am not vainly transported or grow insolent 3 or if
anything falls οιιι crosa, Ι am not much perplexed. Po. Truly, if you
ean do this, you ars a greater philosopher than Thales himself. Gt.
If any uncasiness in my mind rises (as mortal life produces many of
them), Ι cast it immediately οιιι of my thoughts, whether it bs from
the sense of an affront offered or anything done unhandsomely. Po.
Well, but there are some provocations that would raiae the anger of
tha most patient man alive, aethe saucinesses of servants frequently
are. Gt. I suffer nothing to stay long enough in my mind to make
an impression. If 1 can cure them Ι do it, if not 1 reason thus with
myself, What good will it do me ιο torment myself about that which
will be never the better for it l In short, Ι Ιοι reason do that for me
at first which, after a little while, time itaelf would do. And this I·
be sure ιο take care of, not to suffer any vexation, ιο it never so great,
ιο go to bed with me. Eu. N o wonder that you do not grew old,
who ara of that temper. ot Well, and that I may not-conceal any·
thing from friends, in an especial manner I hare kept this guard upon
