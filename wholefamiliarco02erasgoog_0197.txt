190 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIE&

between a rich man and apocr man. oon. Are not sools dressed up
in a different manner from wise menl Inak. I cannot tell how well
it becomes you, but your habit does not differ much from theirs, if it
had but ears and bells. 0οη. These indeed are wanting, and we are
the fools of this world if we really are what we pretend to be.

Innk. What you are 1 do not know; but this I know that there
are a great many sools that wear ears and bells that have more wit
than those that wear caps lined with fnrs, hoods, and other ensigns ol
wise men, therefore it seems a ridiculous thing to me to make a show
of wisdom bythe dress rather than in fact. Ι saw a certain man, more
than a lool, with a gown hanging down to his heels, a cap like our
doctore, and had the countenenee of a grave divine; he disputed
publioly with a show of gravity, and he was as much made on by great
men as any of their lools, and was more a lool than any of them.
Coa. well, what would you inser from thetl That a prince who
laughs at his jester should change coats with himl lant. Perhaps
decorum would require it to be so, il your proposition be true, that the
mind of a man is represented by his habit.

Gon. Yon press this upon me indeed, but I am still os the opinion
that there is good reason for giving fools distinet habits. lurik. What
reasonl Coa That nobody might hurt them if they say or do any· Ι
thing that is loolish [nah. But, on the contrary, I will not say that
their dress does rather provoke some people to do them hunt, insomuch
that ostentimes of fools they become madmen. Nor do Ι see any reason
why a bull that geres a man or- a dog, or a hog that kills a child, should
be punished, and a fool who commits greater crimes should be sull'ered
to live under the protection os his folly. But Ι ask you, what is the
reason that you are distinguished from others by your dressl Foris
every trifling cause is sufficient to require a different habit, then a
beker should wear a different dress from a fisherman, and a shoemaker
· srom a tailor, an apothecary from a vintner, a coachman from a mariner.
And you, if you are priests, why do you wear a habit different from
other priestsl If you are laymen, why do you differ from usl

Coa. In ancient times monks were only the purer sort of the laity,
and there was then only the same difference between a monk and a
layman, as between a frngal honest man that maintains his family by
his industry, and a swaggering highwayman that lives by robbing. „
Afterwards the bishop of Rome bestowed honours upon us, and we
ourselves gave some reputation to the habit, which now is neither
simply laic nor sacerdotal ; but such as it ie, some cardinale aad popes
have not been ashamed to wear it. leet. But as to the decorum of
it, whence comes thatl Cora. Sometimes from the nature of things
themselves, and sometimes from custom and the opinions of men.
Would not all men think it ridiculous for a man to wear a bull's hide,
with the horns on his head, and the tail trailing alter him on the
groundl [nale That would be ridiculous enough. Con Again, if
any one should wear a garment that should hide his face and his hands,
and shew his privy membersl Ioula That would be more ridiculous
than the other. Coa. The very pagan writers have taken notice ol
them that have worn clothes so thiu that it were indecent even for
women themselves to wear such.¹
