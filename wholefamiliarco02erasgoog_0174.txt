ΤΗΕ POEYICAL BANQUET. 167

Hi. Yon have not bit your nails sor nothing. Eu. Well, since my
turn is next, that I may do something:

Qni studet ut variis niteat cultissimus hortus
Deliciis, patiens animum squallere, nec ullis
Artibus expolians, huic est praepostera cura.

“ who caree to have his garden neat and rare,
And doth of ornaments his mind leave bare, ·
Acts but with a preposterous cara”

We have no need to spur Sbrulius on, for he is so fluent at verses that
he ostentimes tumbles them out before he is swero.

St. cui vernat hortus custus et elegans,
N ec pectus ullis artibus excolit,
Praepostera is cura laborat.

Sit ratio tibi prima mentis

“ Who to make his garden spring much care imparts,
And yet neglecte his mind to grace with arta,
Acts wrong. Loolr chiefly to improve thy parta”

Po. Quisquis accurat variis ut hortus
Floribus vernet, neque pectus idem.
Artibus sanctis colit, hunc habet praepcstera cura

“Who to his soul prefers a flower or worse,
May well be said to set the cart before the horse.”

Hi. Now let us try to which ol' us the garden will afford the most
sentences. Le. How can so rich a gardan but do thatl evanthis rose·
hed will furnish me with what to say: As the beauty of a rose is
lading, so is youth soon gone: you make haste to gether your rose
before it withers ; you ought more earnestly to endeavour that your
youth passos not away without fruit. Hi. Itis a theme very fit for a
verse. ι Oa As among trees, every one heth its fruita, so among men
every one bath his natural gift. Eu. As the earth, if it be tilled,
brings forth various things lor human use, and being neglected is
covered with thorus and briars, so the genius ol a man, il it be accom-
plished with honest studies, yields a great many virtues ; but if it be
neglected, is overrun with various vices St. A garden ought to be
dressed every year, that it may look handsome. The mind being once
furnished with good learning, does always flourish and spring forth.
Pa. Ae the pleasantness of gardens does not draw the mind off from
honest studies, but rather invites it to thern, so we ought to seek lor
such recreatione and divertisements ss are not contrary to learning.
Hi. Oh, breve! I see a whole swarm of sentences.

Now lor verse ; but before we go upon that, Ι am ol the mind it
will be no improper nor unprofitable exorcisato turn the first sentence
into Greek verse as osten as we have turned it into Latin. And let
Leonardbegin, that hasbeen an old acquaintance os the Greek poeta.

Le. l will begin, if you bid ma Hi. 1 both bid and command you·

Ia. Ὦ riardo ἔστιν debeor γελῶν καλοῖς,
Ὦ δὲ abac, μάλ’ αὐχμῶν, τοῖς καλοῖς μαθήμασιν
