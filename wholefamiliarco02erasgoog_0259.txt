they shew a wooden altar consecrated to the holy Virgin; it is a very
small one, and remarkable 101 nothing except as a monument 01 01111-
quity, reproaohing the luxury 01 the present times. In that place the
good man is reported to bave taken his 1001 10010 01 the Vir-gin, when
he was at the point 01 death. Upon tho altar is the point 01 the
sword with which the top 01 the head 01 that good prelato was
wounded, and some 01 his braine that were beaten out, to make sure
work 01 11. We most religiously kiseed the sacred rust 01 thie weapon
out 01 1010 10 the martyr.

Leaving this place, we went down into a vault underground; to
that there belong two showcrs 01 101100. The first thing they ehew
you is the skull 01 the martyr, as it was bored through; the upper
part is 1011 open 1011011100οἀ, all the rest ie covered over with silver.
There also is ehewn yona lesden plato with this inscription, Thomas
Acrensis. And there hang up in a great place the shirts of hair-eloth,
the girdles‚ and breeches with which thie prelate used to mortify his
fleeh, the very sight 01 which is enough to atrike one with horror, and
to reproaoh the effeminacy and delicacy 01 our age. Mc. Nay, perhaps
011110 monks themselves. Oy. That 1 can neither affirm nor deny, nor
does it signify much to me. Mc. You say right.

09. From hence we return to the cboir, On the north side they
open a private place. It is incredible what 0 world 01 bones they
brought out 01 11, ekulls, chine, teeth, hands, lingere, whole arms, 011
which we haring first adored, kissed; nor had there beon any end 01
11 had it not beon for one 01 my lellow-travellere, who indiscreetly
interruptcd the officer 11101 was shewing them. Me. Who was hel
09. He was an Englishman‚ his 1101110 was Gratian Pullus, a 11101101
learning and piety, but not so well affected to this part 01 religion as I
could wish he were. Mc. I fancy he was aWickliffite. Oy. No,I
believe he was not, though he had read his books 3 but I do not know
where he had them. Mc. Did he make tho officer angryl Oq. He
took out an arm having yet some bloody flcsh upon it ; he shewed a
reluctance 10 the kissing it, and a sort 01 uneasiness in his counten·
anco: and presently the officcr shut up all his relies again. '

After this we viewed the table 01 11001101, and the ornaments,
and 01101 thet those things that were laid up under the altar: all was
very rich 3 you would have said Midas and Oroesus were beggars com-
pared to them, if you beheld the great quantities 01 gold and silver.
Mc. And was there no hissing hercl 09. No, but my mind was
touched with other sorte 01 wishes Mc. What were theyl 09. 1
made me eigh to think I had no such relice in my own house. Me.
A sacrilegious wieh! 09. I consess it, and I humbly begged pardon
011110 saint before I set my 1001 out 01 the churcb.

Alter this we were camied into the vestry. Good God! what 0
pomp 01 silk vestments was there, 01 goldeu candlesticks! There we
saw also St. Thomas’s foot. It looked like a reed painted over with
silver; itheth but little 01 wcight, and nothing 01 w01·kmansbip,and
was longer than up to one’s girdle. Mc. Wae there nevers crossi
Op. Ieew none. There was 0301110100031110001111,11110011, but
course and without embroidery or jewels, and a handkerghief, still
having plain marks 01 sweat and blood from 1110 saint's neck. We
readily kissed these monuments 01 ancient frugality. Ma Are these
