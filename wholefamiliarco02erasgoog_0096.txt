especially in cur minda And the better tc fit us for the reception of
so divine a guest, if you will, you shall have some portion of scripture
read inLthe interim, but so that you shall not let that hindei· you from
eating your dinner hesrtily. Ti. We will eat hcartily, and attend
dili ently.

ἕΙιά. 'l'his entertainment pleases me so much the better, because it
diverte vain and frivolous discourse, and affords matter of profitable
conversation. Iam not cf their mind who think no entertainnrent
diverting, that does nct abound with foolish wanton stories and bawdy
’ songs. There is pure joy springs from a clear and pure conscience ;
and those are the happy conversations where such things are men·
tioned that we can reflect upon afterwards with satisfaction and
delight; and not such as we shall afterwards be ashamed of, and have
occasion to repent of ri. It were well if we were all as careful to
consider those things as we are sure they are true. Eu. And besides,
these things have not only a certain and valuable profit in thern, but
one month’s use of them would make them become pleasant too. ri..
And therefore it is the best course we can take tc accustom curselves
to that which is hest. Ea. Read us something, boy, and speak out
distinctly. Boy. Prov. xxi. “The king's hcart is in tho hand of the
Lord; as the rivers of wetere, He turneth it whithersoever He will.
Every man is right in his own eyes, but the Lcrd pondereth the
hearts. To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to theLord
than sacrifice,” ver. 1-3.

Ea Ι knew our dinner would be unsavoury‚ and therefore Ι procured
this sance. Ti. Here is nothing but what is very good; but if you
had given us this lecture to a dish of beets only, without either pepper,
wine, or vinegar, it would have been adelicicus treat. Eu. Icould
commend it with a better grace if I did but perfeotly understand what
Ι have heard. And Ι would we had some able divine among us that
did not only understand it, but would thoroughly expound it. But Ι
do not know how far it may be lawful for us laymen tc descant upon
these matters. Ti Indeed I see no hurt in it, even for a Tarpawlin
to doit, abatingthe rashness of passing sentence in the case. And
who knows but that Christ Himself (who has promised to be present
where two or three are gathcred together in His name) may vouehsafe
His assistance to us, that are a much larger congregation.

Ea. What if we should take these three verses, and divide them

among us nine guests. Ti. We like it well, provided the master of
the feast lead the way. Eu. Iwcnld not refusa it 3 but that Ι am
afraid Ishall entertain you worse in my exposition than Ι do in my
