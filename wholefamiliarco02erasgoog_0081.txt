Oh. Woll, corne my kind galeata, Ι pray you that you would take
this little supper in good part, though it bc but a slende'r one. Be
merry and good humoured, though the supper be but mean and
slender. I, relyihg upon your familiarity, made bold to invite you;
and Iwill aasure yon, your company and presence is⁴ not only very
grateful to me, but very pleasant. Ga. We do assure you, good
Christian, that we esteem your supper ιο have been very pretty
and noble ; and wo have nothing ιο find fault with, but that you
make excuses sor it, sor that it was very magnificent} for indeed I
look upon the entertainment to be splendid to the greatest degree,
that in the first placo consisted of couraea agreeable to nature,'and
was seasoned with mirth, laughter‚ jokes, and witticisms, none of
which hare been wanting in our entertainment, But here is some-
thing ‘c'ornes into my mind, as to the number of the guests‚ which
Varro writes should not he fewer than three, nor more than nine.
For the Graces, who are the presidente of humanity and benevolence,
are three ; and the Muses, that are the guides of commendable studieS,

for the three Graces3 and as it is netto be thought that Apollo is
ever absent from the chorus of tho Muses, we have very much
apropos added the tenth guest. ol. You have spoken very much
like a poet. If Ι had a laurel here lwould crown you with it, and

ou should be poet laureato. Au. If I were crowned with mallows,
l should be poet maleat; Ι do not arrogata that honour to myself.
This is an honour that Ι don’t deserve.
