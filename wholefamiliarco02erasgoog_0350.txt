THE Aestuet? OB PARLIAMENT OF WOlIEN. 34³ ‘

rathere Billingsgate than a senate [a place of scolding rather than a
place of pleading]. Ca. It will be impossible to do anything without
clerks, to take care that nothing be omitted.

Co. Well‚ then, we have taken care about numbering; in the next
place, how shall we exclude scoldingl Oc. That nohody speak but
when she is asked, and in her turn too. She that does otherwise shall
be expelled the house. And if any one shall be found to blab out what
is transacted here, she shall incur the penalty of a three days' silence.
00· Well‚ ladies, so far wc have settled matters as to the method of
proceeding, now let us consider what we shall debete about. In the
lirst place, we ought to take care of our honour ; and that consiste
chiefly in dress, which matter has been so neglected that newa-days ·
you can scarce know a duchess from a shopkeeper's wife, a married
woman from a maid, or a widow or a metron from a whore. Modesty
ie removed at that distance, that every one wears what apparel she
pleases. You may see those that are scarce one degree on this eide
beggars, and of a base and sordid extraction, dressed in their velvets,
silke, and watered tabbies, gardan setins, sprigged calicoes and chintzes,
in gold and silver, sable tippets, dac, whose husbands in the meantime
eit at home cobbling shoes. Their fingere are loaded with emerald and
’ diamond rings ; sor pearls are now made no account of, not to mention
their amber and corel necklaces, their laced shoes. lt was formerly
thought enough for your ordinary women to be allowed the privilege
to wear a silk girdle‚ and to bordcr their petticoats with a ribbon‚ in
honour of the sex. But now we labour undere double inconveniency ;
the family is beggared, and distinction, which is the life and soul of
quahty, is quite lost.

If the wives of the commenalty must be dragged about in gilded
chariote‚ adorned with ivery scats, and colfoe linings and conch-seete,
what shall duchesses and countesses dol And if a squire’s spouse
shall be allowed to drag atrain efter her of fifteen elle long, what must
a duchess or a countess dol But thereis one thing that is worse than
all this, that by en unaccountable ficklcness we are always altering the
fashion. Formerly our headdresses were mounted upon wires, and by
this dress women of quality were known from ordinary ones. Again,
that the differente might be more visible, they wore caps of armine,
powdered with black spots. But the mob had them presently. Then
they altered the fashion again, and wore black caps ; but the women of
the ordinary sort did not only presume to imitate them, but outdid
them, by adding gold embroidery and jewels to them. Formerly it was

the custom of ladies of quality to comb up their hair from their fore· ·

heads and temples, and to make a tower of it, but this did not last
long; for every baggage soon fell into that fashion, Then they wore
their hair on their soreheads 3 but in this too they were soon followed
by the ordinary sort.

Formerly none but ladies of quality had their gentlemen uehere
and peges, and out of these they chose some pretty smock-faced follow
to take them hythe hand when they arose from their chairs, or to
support their left arm with his right when they valked, hut this
honour was granted to none but gentlemen But now women in
common, following this fashion, admit any mean persons to this office,
and also to bear u p their train too. And whereas formerly, in primitive
