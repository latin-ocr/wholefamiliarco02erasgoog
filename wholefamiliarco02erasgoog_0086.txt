THE PROFANE BANQUET. 79

in a poetical manner, or walk out abroad hythe river-side. Aa.
Indeed, your gardens are very pleasant, but keep that pleasure for
morning walks. When the sun is towards setting rivers afford wonder·
ful pleasant prospecta. Cle. Austin, do you wall( foremost, as a poet
should do, and l will walk by your side. Aa. 0 good God, what a
jolly company we have, what a retinue have Ι l Christian, Ι cannot
utter the pleasure I take, Ι seem to be some nobleman.

ot. Now be es good as your word. Perform the tsslr you have
taken upon you. Au. What is it you would have me speak os
chieflyl Ch. Ι used formerly to admira many things in Pollio's
Oratione ; but chiefly this, that he used so easily, so frequently, and
beautifully to turn a sentence, which seemed not only a great piece of
wit but of great nse. Aa. You were much in the right of it, Christian,
to admire that in Pollio. For he seems, in this matter, to have had a
certain divine faculty, which I believe was peculiar to him, by a
certain dexterity of art, and by much use of speaking, reading, and
writing, rather than by any rules or instructions. Ch. But Ι would
fain have some rule for it, if there be any to be given. Aa. You say
very well 3 and since I see you are very desirous of it, Ι will endeavour
itas much as Ι can ι and Ι will give those rules, as well as Ι can, which
Ihave taken notice ofin Pollio's Oratione. ct. D0,I should be very
glad to hear them. Aa. I am ready to do it.

In the first place, it is to be set forth in pure and choice Latin
words 3 which to do is no mean piece of art: sor there are a great many
who do, Ι don’t know after what manner, effect the copia and variation
of phrase, when they don’t know how to express it once right. It is
not enough for thern to have babbled once, but they must render the
babble much more babbling, ογ first one, and then by another turning
of it, as if they were resolved to try the experiment how barbarously
they were able to speak3 and therefore they heap together certain
simple synonymous words, that are so contrary onc to the other, that
they may admire themselves how they do agree together. For what
is more absnrd than that a ragged old fellow that hasnota coat to his
back but what is so ragged that he may be ashamed to put it on,
should every now and then change his rags, as though he designed to
shew his beggary by way of ostentation. And those affectators of
variety seem equally ridiculous, who, when they have spoken bar·
barcusly once, repeat the same thing much more barbarously ; and then
over and over again much more unlearnedly. This is not to abound
with sentences, but solecisms. Therefore, in the first place, as Ι have
said, the thing is tobe expressed in apt and chosen words. 2. And
then we must use variety of words, if there are any to be found that
will express the same thing ; and there are a great many. 3. And
where proper words are wanting, then we must use borrowed words,
so the way of borrowing them be modest. 4. Wher‘e there is a scarcity
of words, you must have recourse to passives, to express what you
have said by activas, which will allord as many ways of variation
as there were in the activas. 5. And after that, if you plesse, you
may turn them again by verbal nonna and participles. fi. And last of

all, when we have changed adverbs into nouns, and noune sometimes
into one part of speech and sometimes into another, then we may

speak by contraries 7. We may either change affirmative sentences
