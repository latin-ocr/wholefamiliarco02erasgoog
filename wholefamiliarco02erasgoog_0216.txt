and he could not find out any pretence to ask 100 more, ha 01 last
bethought himself 01 this project. He eomes home like one srightened
out of his wits, and in a very mourntul tone eries out, 0 Balbinus, Ι
arn utterly undone, undone 3 I am in danger of my life. Balbinus was
astonished, and was impatient to know what was the matter. The
. court, says he, have got an inkling 01 what we have been about,
and I expect nothing else butte be carried 10 gaol immediately. Bal-
binus at the hearing 01 this turned pale 00 0011005 for you know it is
capital with us for any man to practise alchemy without a licence
from the prinae. He goes on, Not, says he, that I anr afraid of death
myself‚ I wish that were the worst that would happen-I fear something
more 00001. Balbinus asking him what that was, he replied, 1 shall be
carried away into some castle, and there be forced 10 work all my days
100 those Ι baveno mind 10 serve. Is there any death 00 bad as
such 011101

The matter was then debated, Balbinus being a man that very well
understood the art of rhetoric, 00010 his thoughts every way if this mis·
chief could be prevented any way. Caunot you deny the crime, says hel
By no means, says the other, the matter 10 known among the mortiers,
and they have such proof 01 11 that it cannot be evaded‚ and thureis
no defending of the 1001, lor the law is point blank against it. Many
things having been proposed, but coming 10 no conclusion that seemed ,
seasible, says the alchemist who wanted present money, 0·Balbinus,
we apply ourselves 10 slow counsels‚ when the matter requires a
present remedy. It will not be long before they will be hera that will
apprehend me and carry me away into tribulation And 1001 01 011,
seeing Balbinus at 0 stand, says the alchemist, Iam as much ata loss as
you, nor do I see any way 1011 but 10 die like a man, unless you shall
approve what 1 am going 10 propose, which is more profitable than
honourable, but necessity is a hard chapter. You know these sort 01
men ure hungry after money, and 00 may be the more easily bribed 10
secrecy. Although it is 0 hard case to give these raseals money to
throw away 3 but yet, as the c'ase now stands,1 see no better way.
Balbinus was 01 the same opinion, and he lays down thirty guineas to
bribe them to hush up the matter.

Pa Balbinus was wonderfully liberal, as you tell the story. La.
Nay, in an honest cause you would sooner have got his teeth out 01
his head than money. Well, then, the alchemist was provided 100, who
was in no danger, but that 01 wanting money for his wencb. Pla I
wonder Balbinus could not smoke the roguery all this while. Lw.
This is the only thing that heis 0011 in ; he is 00 sharp as 0 needle in
anything else. Now the furnaceis set to work again with new money,
but first a short prayer is made to the Virgin Mary to prosper their
undertakings. By this time there had been a whole year spent, first
one obstacle being pretended and then another, so that all the expense
and labour were lost In the meantime there 1011 out one most
ridiculous chance. Ph. What was thatl Lu. The alchemist had a
criminal correspondente with a certain courtier’s lady. The husband,
beginning to be jealoua, watched him narrowly, and in the conclusion,
having intelligenoe that the priest was in the bedchamber, he eomes
horne before he was looked 100, knocks at the door. Ph. What did
he design to do to himl La. Whatt Why nothing very good, either
