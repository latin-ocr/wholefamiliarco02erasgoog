344 FAMILIAR contusum&

times, none but persons of high extraction saluted one another with a
kias, and did not permit every one to kias them, no not so much aa their
hand3 now-adays a tanner or currier that stinks of the leather shall
presume to kiss a lady of the highest quality. Nay, even in marriages
there is no regard had to honour-noblemen's daughters are married,
to tradesmen's sons, and tradesmen’s daughters to noblemen, so that a
sort of mongrels are brought into the world. Nor is there a wench of
ever so mean a birth but would presumo to use the same paints and
washes that the quality use, when ordinary people ought to be satisfied
with a little ale yeast, or the fresh juice of a tres that has been barked, or
any such thing that costs but little; they ought to leave the fine paints,
washes, and cosmetica to women os quality.

To come now to ublie entertainments and the park, what con·

fusion and disorder is therei A merchant’s wife shall oftentimes reliiae

to give place to a lady of noble descent both by father and mother. So
that the present posture of affairs calls upon us to come to some
resolution as to these matters, and these things may be easily settled
among us, because they belong to none but our own sex. But there ars
also some affairs that we have to settle with the men too, who exclude us
from all honourable employments, and only make us their laundressea
and their ooolrs, while they themselves manage everything according
to their own pleasure. We will allow them the management of publio
offices and military concerns. But is it a sufferable thing that the
wife’s coat of arms should be painted on the left side of the escutcheon,
ι although her family is twice as honourable as that of her husband’al
And in the last place, it is but just that a mothsr’s consent should be
had in putting out the children. And it may be we shall gain the
ascendant so far as to take our turns in the administration of the
public offices, but I mean only those that ean be managed at home
aud without arms. These are the chief heads of the matters which,
in my opinion, deserve our deliberation. Let every one here deliberate
with herself upon these matters, that an aot may be passed concerning
every one of them ; and if any one shall think of anything else that
is necessary to be debated‚ let her communicate it tomorrow, for we
will sit de die ia diem till we have concluded the session. Lct us
have four clerks that may take down our speeches, and two chair-
women, who shall have the power of giving liberty to spealr andos

enjoining silence. And let this meeting be a sample of what may be
expected hereafter.
