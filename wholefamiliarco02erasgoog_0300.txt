THE F UNERAL. 293

had they to sayl Ph. They rattled 011 the parson seundly, calling
him ass, and one litter to be a paster 01 swine than men's seule. l,
says Vincent, am a bacheler 01 divinity, and am shortly to be licensed
and take my degree 01 (100101, and yeu can scaree read the collect, you
010 se far from being fit 10 dive 11110 the seerets 01 0 man's conscience.
But 11 you have such an 11011 01 curiosity, go home and inquire 11110
the privacies 01 your concubine and bastards. And 0 great deal mere
01 such stuff, that Ι 0111 0011001011 10 mention.

Ma. And did he say nothing te all thiel Pu. Nothing, de you
sayl Never was any 111011 00 110111οι1. Ι, says he, will make a better
bacheler 111011 you 01 0 beanstalk; as for your masters, Dominic and
Francis, pray, where did they ever learn Aristotle’s philosophy, 111001111-
1110111001 Thomas, or the speculatione 01 Scotusl Where did they take
their degree 01 bachelorsl Yeu have crept 11110 0 credulous world, a
company 01 mean wretches, though some, Ι must 00111000, were devout ,
and learned. You nested at first in fields and villages, and thence
anon you transplanted yourselves inte epulent 0111000011 none but the
best part 01 them neither would content you. Your business lay then
only in places 11101 could not maintain a paster, but now, forsooth,
110110 but great men’s houses will serve your turn. Yeu beast much
of your being priests, but your privileges are net worth a 111011, 11111000
111 the absence 01 the bislrep, pastor, or his curate. Nota 111011 01 you
shall ever 001110 11110 my pulpit,1 will assure you, as long 00 I 0111
paster. Itis true 10111 110 bacheler, 11010010 was St. 110111110οἀ yet
110 discharged the office 0101101101] 101 all 11101. 11 I have not se much
learning as Ι should, Ι will never cerne a begging 10 you for it. De
you think 1110 world is so stupid as to think the 1101111000 01 Dominio
aud Francis is entailed upon the 11011111 10 11 any business 01 yeurs
what I 110 01 myown heusel It is very well known iu thc world what
you de in your cells, and how you handle your hely virgins. N ebedy
is ignorant 11101 you make 111000 rich men’s heuses you frequent ne
better than they should be.

For 1110 1001, 111010011111110, you must excuse me, it is teo feul te be
told, but in truth 110 haudled the reverend fathers very scurvily3 aud
there had 110011 110 end 01 1111 George had 1101110111 11111110 hand 111
1011011110 had something te say, and it was with much ade that 1110
0101111 was laid at 1001, though but fera little while. Theu says the
siek 111011, Peace be among you, 1 will confess mysclf ever again to you,
Mr. Persen, and 00 101 the charge 01 telling the bell, my funeral-ritas,
my monument and burial, they shall all be paid down to you before
you ge 011101 the house 5 I will take order tlrat you shall 11ον0 110
cause 10 00111111οἰ11. Μα. Did the parson 1011100 this fair propossll
Pa. He did net absolutely refuse it, buthe muttered something te
himself about confession 3 but he remitted it 01 last, and told them
there was no need 01 troubliug the patient or 1110 1111001 with the
same things over again, but if he had confessed te me 111 time, said 110,
perhaps 110 would have made 1110 will upon better conditions3 but if it
be not as it should be, you must now look te it. This cquity 01 the
sick man vexed the menks 10 the heart, who thought very much that
any 1101101 the boety should ge 10 the parson 01 the parish. But upon
my intercessien the matter was compesed3 1110 11010011 gave 1110 sick

menthe unction and the sacrament, received his dues, and went away. -.
