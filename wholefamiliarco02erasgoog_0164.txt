THE POETIOAL BANQUET. 15⁷

call you Blitea instead οι Margarita οο. Ha, ha, ha. Mo. Your
calling me will neither make me latter nor leairer. He calls me by
twenty names in a day’ s time. when he has a mind to wheedle me,
then Ι am called Galatea, Euterpe, Calliope, Callirhoe, Melissa, Venus,
Minerva, and what not; when heis out of humour at anythiirg, theri
presentlyIam Tisiphone, Megaera, Alecto, Medusa, Baucis, andwhatso-
ever comes into his head ιιι his mad moed. Hi. Get you gone with
your beets, Blitea Ma. I wonder what you called me for. Hi.

That you may go whence you came. Ma. It1s an old saymg anda v

· true, it ss an easier matter to raise the devil than it is to lay him.
00 Ha, ha, ha: very well said. As tho matteris, Hilsry, you stand

ipapieed οι some magio verse to lay her with. Hi. I have got one
r y.

<kruyers κανθάριὸες λύκος ἄγριος ὔμμε diuisas. '

“Be gone, ye beetles, for the cruel wolf pursues you.'’

Mo. What says AEsopl Or. Have a care, Hilary, she will hit you a
slep on the face. This is your laying her with your Greek verse. A
notable conjuror indeed ! Ili. Grato, what do you think οι this jade l
I could have laid ten great devils with such a verse as this. Mo. Ι
donet care a straw for your Greek verses. Hi. well, then, Imust
make use οι a magioal spell, or, if that will not do, Mercury’s mace.
Cr. My Margaret, you know we poete sre a sort οι enthusiasts Ι wont
say madmen· ,prithee, let me entreat you to let alone this contentiori
till another time, and treat us with good humour at this supper for my
sake Ma. What does he trouble me with his verses fori Often when
Iamtogo to market he has never a penny οι money to give me und
yet heis ahumming οι verses. Or. Poets are such sort οι men But
however, prithee, do as Ι say. Mo. IndeedI will do ιι for your sake,
because Ι knew you are an honest gentlemsn that never beat your
brain about such fooleries. I wonder how you came to fall into such
company. Or. How come you to think sol Mo. Because you have
ιι full nose, spsrkling eyes, and a plump body. Now do but see how he
leers and snsers at me Cr. But, prithee, sweetheart, keep your
temperior my sake. Ma. Well, I will ge, and it is ιοι your sake, and
nobody's else. Hi. Is she gonel Ma. Not so far but she can hear
you Mus. Sbeisinthe kitchen now muttering something to herself
Icannot tell what. Or. Iwill assure you your maid' rs not dumb.
Hi They say a good maid· servant ought especially to have three
qualifications—to be honest, ugly, and high· spirited, which the vulgar
call evil. An honest servant will not waste, an ugly one sweethearts
will not woo, and onet t'hat 1s high-spirited will defend her master's

is surly3 as to her honesty‚I cannot tell what to say to that. Or.
We have heard her tongue, we were afraid οι her hands upon your
account. ·
Ηι. Take some οι these pompions : we have done with the lettuces,
for I know ιιΙ should bid her bring any lettuces she would bring
thistles. Here are melons too, ιι anybody likes them better. Here
are new fige too, just gathcred, ss you may see by the milk in the stalks.
