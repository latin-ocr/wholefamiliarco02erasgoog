1110111011 should bc three times as long as that of Nestor. For that
putting the hand into the flama is some part 01 110 1110 01 11011, 101 11
be never so small 0 010 ; but the whole 1110 01 a man is no part 01
eternity. sp. I have nothing to say against it. 110. Resides, they

that hasten forwards with all their heart and a certain hope, when'the
way is so short, do you believe they are tormented with the troubles
01 1110 life 1 sp. I do not think they are, 11 they havea certain belief
and firm hope 01 attaining 1011.

Hc. I come now 1ο those delights yon took notice of: they
abstain 110111 balls, banquets, and plays; thoy so despise them that·
· they enjoy those that are unroh pleasanter. They do not take less
pleneme, but they take it after another manner. “The eye has not
scen, nor the 001 heard, nor has it entered into the 10011 01 1101 10
conceive what comforts God has prepared for those 11101 love Him.”
Blesscd Paul was acquainted with 1110 songs, daucos, exultatione, and
banquets 01 pious minds in this 1110, Sp. But there are some lawful
pleasures which they abridge themselves 01.

110. Τ10 immoderate uso 01 such pleasnres as 010111 themselves
10111111 is unlawl‘ul, 11 yon except that they who seem 10 live this
austere life cxceed others in enjoyment What can be a more noble
spectacla than the contemplation 01 this world l Men that are in Ged's
favour take 101 more plcasure in that contemplation than other men ;
101 while they, out 01 curiosity, contemplate this wonderful fabrio,
they 1110 perploxcd in their minda because they cannot attain to the
knowledge 01 110 causes 01 many things And in some cases, like
Monnrs’s, 00110110111111103011011101101111101, 01101 calling nature,
which is indeed a 1101101,001ορ111011101, which reflectiou‚ though in
word it be levelled against nature, yet rebounds on Him that is the
author 01 nature, 11 indeed there is any such thing as nature. But a
godly man, with religione and pure eyes, beholds the works 01 God his
father with great pleasure 01 mind, admiring evcrything, finding fault
with nothing, but giving thanks 101011 things, when he considers that
all these things were mado 101 man, and so in everything adores 110
omnipotence, wisdom, and goodness 01 1110 Creator, the 100101ορ001
which he pereeives in the things created. Imagine 101 once that there
were really such 0 palace as Apuleius leigned 101 Psyche, or something
more magnificent and fine, 11 11 can be, and suppose two spectators,
one 0 stranger, who only cameto see it, the 01101· a servant, 010 son
01 him that built it, which 01 them will take the greatest pleasure in
the sightl 110 stranger who has nothing to do with the house, or the
son who beholds the genius, wealth, and magnifieenee 01 a 11001 father
in that building with great pleasure, especially when he reflecte that
all this fabric was made 101 his own 0111101

Sp. Your question nceds 1ο answer 3 but the greatest part that
are 101 religious know net that heaven, and what is contained 11010111,
was made 101 the sake 01 man. Hc. They 011 know it, but they do
not all consider itj and 11 11 does come into their mind, yet hc takes
the most pleasure that loves the workman best, as he looks mest
eheerfully upon heaven that breathes 01101 0101101 life. Sp. There
seems 1ο be 0 grem deal of truth in what you say.

Hc. Now, as to banquets, the sweetness 01 them does not consist
so much 11 the having a clainty palate, or in the seasonings 01 110 1001,
