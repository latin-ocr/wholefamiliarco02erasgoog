THE POEYIOAL BANQUET. lte

great part of it is past already. It is my opinion it ought to be read,
we foresee death. For we foresee those things which are a great way
off from ua when death, for the most part, is gone by us. Ee. If
philosophare do sometimes give themselves leave to go asida into the
meadows of the musea, perhaps it will not be amisa for us if we, to
gratify our fancy, take a turn into their territories. Hi. Why nott
Le As Ι was lately reading over again Aristotle's book that he

entitles Περι τῶν Ἐλέγῖμν, the argument of which is, for the most
part, common both to r etoricians and philosophers, Ι happened to

fall upon some egregious mistakes of the interpretem ; and there is no
doubt but that they that are unskilled in the Greek have often missed
it in many places. For Aristotle proposes a sort of such kind of ¹

ambiguity as ariees from a word of a contrary signification. Ὀτιμαν·
θάνιισιν oi ἐπιστάμενοι· τά γὰρ άποαοματιζόμενα μανθάνωσιν οἱ
Γραμματικοὶ· τὸ γὰρ μανθάνειχὸ μώνυμον, τὸ τε ξυνιέναι χρωωενον
τῆ irruitur), καὶ τὸ λαμὲάυειν την ἑπισὴμην. And they turn it thus.

Because intelligent persons learn, for grammarians are only tongue-
learned ; forto learn is an equivocal word, proper both to him that
exerciseth and to him that receiveth knowledge. Hi. Methinks you
speak Hebrew‚ and not English. Le. Have any of you heard any
equivocal wordl Hi. No.

Le. What then can be more foolish than to desire to turn that
which cannot possibly be turned. For although the Greek word

μανθάνειν signifies as much as μαθεῖν and μαθετιυειν, so among the
Latina, discere, to learn, signifies as much as doctrinam acciperem
doctrinam tradere. But whether this be true or not Ι cannot tell. Ι

rather think μανθάνειν is of doubtful signification with the Greeks,
as cognoscere is among the Latine. For he that informs, and the judge
that learns, both of them know the cause. And so Ι think among the

Greeks the master is said μανθάνειν whilst he hears his scholare, aa
also the scholars who learn of him. But how gracefully hath he turned

that ra' γάρ άποαοματιζόμενα μανθάνωσιν οἱ Γραμματικοὶ, nam secun·
<lura oe Grammatici decant: for the grammarians are tongue-learned;
since it ought to be translated, ivam Gramraotice', quor dictitant, decern,
Grammarians teach what they dictate. Here the interpretare ought
to have given another expression, which might not express the same
words, but the same kind of thing. Though Ι am apt to suspect here
is some error in the Greek copy, and that it ought to be written
ὁμώνυμον τῶ τε ξυνιέναι καὶ τῶ λαμΕάνειυ.

And a little after he subjoins another example of ambiguity,
which arises not from the diversity of the signification of the same

word, but from a different connection. Τὸ βούλεσθαι λαέιῖν με τοὺς

πολεμίας, volleme accipere μνααααιοι, to be willing that Ι should receive
the fighting men 3 for ao he translates it, instead of celle me capere hortea
to be willing that I take the enemies; and if one should read βούλεσθε
it is more perspicuoua. Vultis ut ego capiam sttee? will ye theti
take the enemiesl For the pronoun may both go before and follow
the verb capere. If it go before it the sense will be this, Will ye that
I take the enemiesl If it follows, then this will be the sense, Are you
willing that the enemies should take mel He adda also another
