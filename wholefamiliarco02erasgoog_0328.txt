THE UNEQUAL Maeniana. , 321

although if it were my fortune to sit at the belm, Ι would banish them
both from civil society. But if any one married one that was infected
with this disease, who told her he was a sound man, and I were choson
pope, l would make this marriage void, although it had been confirmed
by a thousand contracta. Pe. Upon what pretence, I wonderl for
marriage legally contracted cannot be disannulled by any human power.

Ga. Whatf Do γοα think that legally eontracted which is
contracted treachelouslyl A contract is not validis a slave palms
himself upon a maid fora freeman, and she marries him as such. She
that marries such a slave marries an errant slave; aad ber slavery is
so much the more unhappy, in that the lady Psora never makes any-
body free3 that there is no comfortable hope of ever being delivered
from this slavory. Pe. Indead, you have found out a colour for it.
Ga. And besides, there can be no such thing as marriage but between
those persons that are living 3 but in this case a woman is married to
adead man. Pe. Yon have found out another pretence. But I
suppose you would permit pocky folks to marry pocky, that, according
to the old proverb, there might be like to like. Ga. If it was lawful
for me to act for the good of the public,I would suffer them to be
married together, but Ι would burn them after they were married.
I’e. Then you would act the part of a tyrant, not of a prince.

Ga. Do you account a surgeon to bo a tyrant who cuts off some of
the fingers, or burne some part to preserve the whole bodyt I do not
look upon that to be cruelty, but rather mercy. And Ι wish this had
been done when this distemper first appeared in the world, then the
public welfare of mankind had been consnlted by the destruction of a
few. And we lind exemplos of this in theFrench historica. Pe. But
it would be a gentler way to gcld them, or part thern asnnder. Ga.
And what would you have done to the women, prayl Pe. I would
padloek them up. Ga. That is one way, indeed, to preventus from
having more of the breed 3 but I will confess it is a gentler way, if you
will but own the other to be safer. Even those that arc castrated have
an itching desire upon thern 3 noris the infection conveyed by one way
only, but by a kiae, ογ discourse, by a touch, or by drinking withan
infected party. And we find also that there is a certain malicious
disposition of doing mischief peculiar to this distemper, that whoso
ever has it takes a delight to propagate it to as many as he can,
though it does him no good. Now, if they be only separated, they may
llee to other places, und may either by night impose upon persons, or
on them that do not know them. But there can be no danger from
the dead. Pa I confess it is the safest way, butI cannot tell whether
it is agreeable to Christian gentleness orno.

Ga Prithee, tell me, then, from whom is there the most danger,
from common thieves or from such cattlef Pe. l confess money is of
much less valae than health. Ge. And yet we Christiane hang them,
nor isit accounted cruelty, but justice; and if you consider the public
good, it is our duty so to do. Pe. But in this case the person is
punished that did the injury. Ga. What, then these, 1 warrant you,
are benefactore to the publici But let us suppose that some get this
distemper without any fault of their own, though you will find thet
very few have it that do not get it by their own wickedness: the
lawyers will tell you it is sometimes lawful to put the innocent to
