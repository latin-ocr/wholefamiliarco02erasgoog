202 FAMILIAR OOLLOQUIES.

In the end Faunus, upon the pressing importunity of Polus,
undertakes the business of exorcism, and slept not one wink all that
night, in contriving by what means he might go about the matter with
safety, for he was wretchedly afraid. In the first place he got together
the most powerful exorcisma that he could get, and added some new
'ones tc them, as the bowels of the Virgin Many and the bones of St.
Winifred After th'at he makes choice of a place in the plain field,
near the bramble husbes from whence the voice came. He draws a
very large circle with a great many crossen in it, and a variety of
, characters. And all this was performed in a set form of words; there
'was also there a great vessel full of holy water, and about his neck he
had a holy stole (aa they called it), upon which hung the beginning of
the Gospel of St. John. He had in his pocket a little piece of wax,
which the bishop of Rome used to consecrate once a year, whichis
commonly called Agnus Dei. With these arms in times past they were
went to defend themselves against evil spirits, before the cowl of St.
Francis was found to be so formidable. All these things were provided,
lest if it should be an evil spirit, it should fall foul upon the exorcist 3
nor did he for all this dare to trust himself in the circle alone, but he
determiued to take some other priest along with him. Upon this
Polus being afraid, that if he took some sharper fellow than himself
along with him, the whole plot might come to be discovered, he got a
parish priest thereabout, whom he acquainted beforehand with the
whole design3 and, indeed, it was necessary for the carrying on the
adventure, and he was a man fit for such a purpose. ·

The day following, all things being prepared and in good order,
about ten 0’clock Faunus and the parish priest enter the circle. Polus
had got thither before them, and made a miserable howling out of the
hedge ; Faunus begins his exorcism, and Polus steals away in the dark
to the next village, and brings from thence another person, for the
play could not be acted without a great many of them. rao. Well,

and privately carry fire along with them ; when they come pretty near
to the circle they shew the fire to affright Faunus out of the circle.

horsea were so startled at the sudden flashing of the fire that they
had like to have thrown their riders. Here is an end of the first act
of this comedy.

When they were returned and entered into discourse, Polus, as
though he had known nothing of the matter, inquires what was done.
Faunus tells him that two hideous Cacodemons appeared to him on black
horsea, their eyes sparkling with fire, and breathing lire out of their
nostrils, making an attempt to break into the circle, but that they were
driven away with a vengeance by the power and efficacy of his words.
This encounter having put courage into Faunus, the next day he goes
into his circle again with great solemnity, and after he had provoked
the spirit a long time with the vehemence of his words, Polus and his
