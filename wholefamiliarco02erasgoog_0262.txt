THE RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGE. 255

These things are shewn to none but great persons or peculiar friends.
In the end we were aar·r¹ied back into the vestry. There was pulled
out a cheat covered] with bltck leather 3 it was set upon the table and
opened. They all fell down 011 their knecs aad worshipped. Mc.
What was in itl Oq. Pieces of lincn rags, a great many of them
retaining ‘still the marks of the snot. These were those, they say, that
the hely man used to wipe the sweat off hom his face and neck with,
the suot out of his nose, or any other such sort of filth which human
bodies are not free from. Δ

Here again my Gratian behaved himself is none ef the most
obl' ing manners 3 for the gentle prior offered to him, being an
Eng'iishman, an acquaintance, and a man of considerable authority,
one of the rags for a present, thinking he bad presented him witha
very acceptable gift 5, but Gratias unthankfully took it squeamishly in
his fingens, and laid it down with an air of contempt, making up his
mouth at it as if he would have smacked it. For this was his custom,
if anything (ame in his way that he would express his contempt to. I
was both ashamed and afraid. Neverthelesa the good prior, though
not insensible of the affront, seemed to take no notice of it·; and after
he had ci'villy entertained us with a glass of wine, dismissed us, and
we went back to London.

Me. What need was there for that when you were not far from
your own shorel Op. I was not, but Iindustn'ously shunned that
shore, it being more insamoua for cheats and rapines than any rocks
are for shipwrecks. Ι will tell you what I saw in my last passage that
way. There was a pretty many of us upon the shore of Calais, who
were carried thence iu a chaloupe to a large ship. Among the rest
there was a young Freuchman that was poor and ragged, and they
demanded twopence for his passage, for so much they will have if they

or twelve pieces of silver between the soles. They took the money,
laughed at him to his face, and bantered the Frenchman as a cheat
into the bargain. Me. What did the fellow do thenl 09. What
should he do but lament his missortunel

Ma Do they do these things by authorityl Op. By the same
authority that they steal the baggage of a guest iu his inn, or take his
purse upon the road, if they find an opportunity. Me. It is very
strange that they dare to commit such villainy before so many wit-
nesses. Oy. They are so used to it that they think they do wellin
it. There were many in the great ship who looked on, and some
English merchants in the boat who grumbled at it, but to no purpose.

·’ They boasted of it as a piece of wit in catching the Frenchman iu his

roguery. Me. Ι would hang up those coast thieves, and laugh at
them, and banter them at the gallows. Oy. N ay, both shores abound
with such fellows. Hence Ῑ make this improvement, If the little
thieves dare to do thus, what will their masters dol So that I had
rather for the future go ever so far about than that shortest way.
And besides, as the descent to hell is easy but the return is difficolt,
