The young man, being come to this pinch, replies very smartly: Most
invincible Caesar, Ι dc not 1611166 16 give an account, butam not very
well skilled in these sort 61 6666111116, never having given any 3 but
these that sit here are very ready 61 such accounts. If I do but once
666 how they make up such accounts, Ι 6611 very easily imitate them.
I entreat you to command them but to shew me an example, and they
shall 66616111 very docible. Caesar perceivcd what ,116 meant, but
they upon whom it was spoken did not, and smiling, answered him,
You say true, and what you demand is nothing but what is reasonable,
and so dismissed the young man3 161 116 intimated that they used to
bring 111 such accounts to Caesar as he had, that is, 16 keep good part

Le. Now 1116111116 that our story-telling should 11666, 66 they say,
116111 better 16 116166, from kings to Anthony, a priest of Louvain, who
was much in favour with Philip sumamed the Good. There arc a 111661
many things told 61 this man, both merrily said and wittily done, but
most 61 thern are something slovenly; 161 he used to season many 61
his jokcs with a sortes perfume that has not a handaome sound buta
. worse scent. Iwillpick outone 61 1116 1116611661 61 them. He had
given an invitation to one or two merry fellows that 116 had met with
by chance as 116 went along, and when he comes home 116 finds a cold
kitchen, nor had he any money in his pocket, which was no new thing
with him3 here was but little time 161 consultation. Away he goes
and says nothing, but going into the kitehen of a certain usurer (that
was an intimate acquaintance by reason 61 frequent dealings with him),
when the maid was gone 611161 the way hc makes off with one of the
brass 1161611111 the meat ready boilcd, under his coat, carries it 1161116,
gives it to his cookjmaid, and bids her pour out 1116 meat and broth
into another earthen pot, and rub the usurer’s brass 6116 1111 11 16
brigbt. Having 116116 this he sends his boy to the pawnbroker to
borrow two groats upon it, but charges him to take a note that should
be 6 testimonia] that such a pot had been sent him. The pawnbroker,
not knowing the 1161, being scoured so bright, takes the pawn, gives
him a note, and lays him down the money, and with that money 1116 boy

up, the pot was missing. Η6 11661116 61 1116 cook-maid. She being put
hardly to it, affirmed nobody had been in the kitchen all that day but
Anthony. It seemed an ill thing to suspect a pricat But, however, at
last they went to him, scarched 1116 1161166 161 tha pot, but no pot was
found. But, in short, they charged him home with the 1161, because he
was the only person who had been in the kitchen till the pot was
missing. He confessed that 116 had borrowed a pot, but that he had
sentit home again tohim from whom 116 had it. But they donyiug it
stiffly, aud high words arising, Anthony calling 661116 witnesses, Look
you, quoth he, how dangerous a thing it is to have dealings with men
now-adays without a note under their hands. I should have been in
danger 61 being indicted 161 felouy 11 Ι had not had 1116 pawnbroker’s
own hand to shew. And with that 116 produces the note 61 his hand.
