THINGS AND WORDS. 30⁷

the name than the thing itself. Ba In some sort of things, I consess,
that many had rather have the thing than the name; but in many

things it is quite the contrary. Bo. l don’t very well take you in.
Be. We have an example 01 11 in ourselves. You are called Boniface,
and you have what you are called, but 11 you were to be deprived 01
either 01 1110111, had you rather have an ugly face or be called Comeliusl
Bo. Why, indeed, l had rather be called Thersites than have 01000 as
ugly as 1110 det-il: whether l have 0 handsome one now or not Ι can·
not tell.

‘ Be. Thau, again, 11 1 was rieh and must either part with my
wealth or my name, I had rather be called Irus than be deprived 01
my estate. Bo. 1 grant what you say to be true, and Ι am 01 opinion
11 is the common temper 01 those that enjoy health and 011101 corporeal
111101101111111111111111111111101111
aud piousl Bo. Iknow a great many 0111110 sort 01 poople. Be. Well,
then, is not the name more esteemed among us than the thing itselll
Bo. So it seems to be. Be. Now, 11 we had a good logician, who could
properly define what a king, a bishop, 0 magistrate, and a philosopher
was, it is very likely we should find some among them who are more
101· the name than the thing 110011. Βο. He is really a king who aims
at the good 01 his people, and not his own, governing them by law and
justice; and he a bishop who vatehes oarefully over the Lord's doch,
andhe isa magistrate who sincerely studies the good 01 the public.
And a philosopher is one who, neglecting 1110 goods 01 10110110, 011ιά100
only to get the endowments 01 the mind. Be. By these you may 000
how many examples 01 this kind 1 could produce. Bo. Why, truly,
0 great many. Be. Will you deny all 111000 10 be menl Be. Ι 0111
afraid we shall sooner lose the name 01 111011 0111001100.

Be. But 11 0100100101101101011111101, how contrary is it 10 reason
that 1111110000100100000,1011101111011 the real goods 01 the body, and
in external things which 10110110 gives and takes away at her pleasure
we had rather have the thing itself than the name, and in the real
goods 01 1110 mind we put more value upon the name than the thing
itself. Bo. lt is an absurd way 01 judging, 11 0 man did but con·
sider it seriously. Be. And the reason is quite the same in those
things that are on the contrary side. Bo. Iexpeot what you 010
tlttt tlh„ 1111ἷί ttttttttttttddttttlttltndt
that 01010 bedesired. Bo. That is plain. Be. For to be 0 tyrant
is more to be abhorred than 10 have the name ; and 11 0 hishop be a
bad man, the scripture calls him a thiel and a robber. These names
are not to be detested by us so much as the things themselves. ‚Ba
In truth, I am 01 your mind. Bo. Do you 1111011110 same 00 10
111010011 Bo. 1 understand you perfeotly well.

Be. Do not all 10010 hate to be called 100101 Βο. Yes, indeed,
and more than other folks. Be. Would not he be 01001 that should
fish with a golden hook, and prefer glass before jewelsl that should
put more value upon his horsea than his wife and childrenl Bo. He
would bea greater 1001 111011 Ben 01 the Minoriea Be. Are not they
such 10010 11101 1101 themselves for soldiers, and for the salre 010 poor
