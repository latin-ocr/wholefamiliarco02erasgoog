in tho last plaoe, who, 101 tho 00110 01 enjoying tho fleeting pleasures 01
this life, deservo eternal tormentsl Bo. Reason itsolf obliges a man
to confess that they are worse than fools. Be. But though every
plaoois full 01 00011 10010 00 these, you 000 000100 find ono that 000
bear to bo called a fool, though they have no aversion 10 being fools.
Bo. Itis really so.

Be. Come on, you know everybody 110100 10 bo oalled aliar or a
thief. Bo. They aro very hateful names, and not without reason.
Be. But for all that, though 10 debauoh another man's wife 10 0 greater
sin than theft, 00010 glory in tho namo of adulterers; and if you were
to oall them thieves they would draw their swords upon you Bo.
This is a 00100100 thing with a great many. Ba And, again, though
many give themselves up 10 whoring and drinking, and do it publioly,
yet 11 you should eall thom wheremastors they would be highly offended

1110 name of a liar. Bo. I know some that would run a man through
that should affront them by giving them tho lie. Be. But I wish they
did 00 much abhor tho practice. Have you never had it hoppen to
you, that ho that promised to pay you what you lent him, upon a
certain day, failed youl Bo. Ay, very often; and though he had
swern to it 100, and not only ouoo, but over and over. Be. But it
may bo they were not eblo to pay. Bo. Nay, they were able enough,
but they thought it moro 10 their advantage to 10111 01000. Be. And
is 00111110 lyingl Bo. Ay, downright. Be. And did you dare to
say to this debtor, Why have you told me so many 11001 110. No,

Be. Ay, you might give 0 thousand instanoes moro, 00100001 which

with these lies

Be. So, in like manner, nobody will bear 10 bo called 111101, when at
the 00100 11010 they have not the same abhorrenoo 01 stealing. Bo. I
would have you tell me plainly what differenoe thore is between him
