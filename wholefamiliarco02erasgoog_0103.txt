96 FAMILIAR comoedias,

meets, according to the necessity of the body. But there were some
salse apostles who went about to persuade them that some meats were,
in themselves, by their own nature unclean‚ and were ιο be sorborne,
not upon occasion only, but at all times, and that aa strict aa adultery
or murder. Now those that were thus misled were reduced under
anotlrer’s power, and fell irem their gospel liberty. Theophylact (as Ι
remember) is the only man that advuncea an opinion different from all
these : “Itis lawful,'' says he, “ to cat all sorta of meats; but it is not
expedient ιο eat to excess; sor from luxury comes lust.’' There is no
impiety, indeed, in this sense3 but it does not seem to me to be the
. genuine sense of the place. Ihave acquainted you with my scruples,
it will become your charity ιο set me to rights.

Εο. Your discourse is, indeed, answerable ιο your name; and one
that knows how ιο propound questions as you do, has no need of any-
body ιο answerthem but himself. For you have so proposed your
doubts as ιο put one quite out ol doubt, although St. Paul in that
epistle (proposing to handle many things at once) passes often from
one argument to another, repeating what he had intermitted.

Oh. ΙΙΙ were not afraid that by my loquacity I should divort you
from eating your dinners, and did think it were lawful ιο intermix any-
thing out of profane authors with sacred discourses, Ι would venture
ιο propose something that Ι read today, not so much with perplexity,
as with a singular delight.

Εο. Whatsoever is picus, and conducas to good manners, ought
not ιο he called profane. The first place must indeed be given ιο the
authority ol the Scriptures3 but nevertheless‚I sometimes find some
things said or written hythe ancients, nay‚ even by the heathens‚ hay,
by the poeta themselves, so chastely, ao holily, and so divinely‚ that Ι
cannot persuade myself but that when they wrote them they were
divinely inspired3 and perhaps the spirit of Christ diffusos itself farther
than we imagine3 and that there are more saints than we have in our
catalogue. Το confess sreely among friends, 1 cannot read Tully “On
Old Age,'' “On Friendship‚’¹ his “ Offices,” or his “ Tusculan Ques-
tions,” without kissing the book, and veneration sor that divine soul.
Audon the contrary, when I read some of our modern authors,
treating of politica, economirs, and ethica, good Godt how cold they
arsin comparison of thesel N ay, how do they seem ιο be insensible
ol what they write themselves? So that I had rather lose Scotus, and
twenty more such aa he, than one Cicero or Plutarch. Not that Ι am
wholly against them neither, but because, by the reading of the oneI find
mysell become better 3 whereas Ι risa from the other I know not how
eoldly affected to virtue, but most violently inclined ιο cavil and con·
tention ; therefore never sear to propose it, whatsoever it is.

Oh. Although all Tully’s books of philosophy seem to breathe out
something divine, yet that treatise on old age that he wrote in old
age, seems to me to be according to the Greek proverb: the song of
the dying swan. Ι was reading it today‚ and these words pleasing me
above the rest, I got them by beart: “ Should it please God to give
me a grant to begin my life again from my very cradle, and once more
to run over the course oi my years I have lived, I would not upon any
terma accept of it. Nor would I, having in a manner finished my rece,
run it over again from tha atarting place ιο the gaal For what
