ΟΝ SPEAKING UNTRUTHFULLY. lll ,

from nature; but art and use have enlarged the faculty. Phil. Why,
are you not mhamed ef itl Pseud. No more than a cuckoo is ol her
singing. Phil. But you can alter your note upon every occasion.
The tongue of man was given him to speak the truth. Pseud. Ay,
to speak those things that tend to hie profit. The truth is not to be
spoken at all times Pau. It is sometimes for a man's advantage to
have pilfering hands, and the old proverb is a witness that that is a
vice that is cousin-german te yours of lying. Psercd. Both these
vices are supported by good authorities Onchas Ulysses, so much
commended by Homer, and the other has Mercury, that was a god, for
its example, if we believe the poets. Phil. Why, then, do people in
common curse liars and hang thievesl Pseud. Not because they lie
or steal, but because they do it bunglingly or unnaturally, not rightly
understanding the art.

Phil. Is there any author that teaches the art of lyingl Pseud.
Your rhetoricians have instructed in the best part of the art. Phil.
These, indeed, present us with the art of well speaking. Pseud. True:
and the good part of speaking well is to lie cleverly. Phil. What is
elever lylngl Pseud. Would you have me define itl Phil. I would
have you do it. Pseud. It is to lie so that you may get profit by it,
and not be caught in a lie. Pau But a great many are caught in
lying every day. Pseud. That is because they are not perfect masters
of the art. Phil. Are you a perfect master in itl Pseud. In a
manner. Phil. See -if you can tell me a lie, so as to deceive me.
Pseud. Yes, best of men, Ι can deceive you yourself‚ if I have a mind
to it. Ptd Well, tell me some lie or other then. Pseud. Why,I
have told one already, and did you not catch me in itl Phil. No.
Pseud. Come on, listen attentively; now Ι will begin to lie then.
Phil. I do listen attentively; tell one. Pseud. Why, Ι have told
another lie, and you have not caught me. Phil. In truth, Ι hearne
lie yet. Pseud. Yuu would have heard some if you understood the
art. Phil. Do you shew it me then.

Pseud. First of all, Ι called you the best os men 3 is not that a
swinging lie, when you are not so much as goodl And if you were
good, you could not be said to be the best5 there are a thousand others
better than you. Phil. Here, indeed, you have deceived me. Pseud.
Well, now try if you ean catch me again in another lie. Phil. I
cannot. Pseud. I want to have you shew that sharpness of wit that
you do in other things Phil. I confess I am deficient. Shew me.
Pseud. When l said now Ι will begin to lie, did I not tell you a ,
swinging lie then, when I had been accristomed to lie for so many
years, and I had also told a lie just the moment before. Phil. An
admirable pieee of witchcraft.

Pseud. Well, but now you have been forewarned3 prick up your
ears, listen attentively, and see if you can catch me in a lie. Phil. 1
do listen attentively, say on. Pseud. Ι have said already, and you
have imitated me in lying. Pau. Why, you will persuade me I have
neither ears nor eyes by and by. Pseud. When men’s ears are
immovable, and can neither be pricked up nor let down, Ι told a lie
in bidding you prick up your ears. Phil. The whole life of man is
full of such lies Pseud. N ot only such as these, Ο good man, ⁶for

these are but johas. But there are these that bring profit. Phil,
