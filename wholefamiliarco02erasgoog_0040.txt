Oomnmnn nnn Proxuma-‚lm prey you take a special
cars of this matter. I earnestly entreat you to take care of this
affair. If you have any respect for me, pray manage this affair
diligently. Pray bo very oareful in this affair. Pray take a great
deal of aare about this business for my sake. If you are indeed
theman I always took you tc be, let me see in this concern what ⁴
esteem you bavo for me. Sa. Say no more, I will dispatch this
affair for you, aud that very shortly too. I cannot indeed warrant
you what the event shall be, but this Ι promise you, that neither
fidelity nor induatry shall be wanting in me. I will talre more
care of it than if it were my own affair. Though, indeed, that
which is my friend’s I account as my own. I will so manage the affair,
that whatever is wanting, care and diligente shall not be wanting.
Talre you no care about the matter, I will do it for you. Do you be ·
easy, I will take the management of it upon myself. I am glad to
have an opportunity put into my hand of showing you my respect.
Ido not promise you in words, but 1 will in reality perform what·
soever is to be expected from a real friend, and one that heartily
wishes you well. Iwill not bring you into a fool’s paradise. Iwill
do that which shall give you occasion to say you trusted the affair to
a friend.

Succusa-Sa. The matter suooeeded better than Ι could have ex-
pected. Fortune has favoured both our wishes. If fortune had been
your wife she could not have been more observant to you. Your affair
went on bravely with wind and tide. Fortune has outdone our very
wishes. You must needs be a favourite os fortune, to whom all things
fall out just as you would have them. Ihave obtained more than Ι
could presnme to wish for. This journey has been performed, from
beginning to end, with all the fortunate circumstances imaginable.
The whole affair has fallen out according to our wish. This chance
fell out heppily forus. Ithink we have been lucky to admiration, that
what has been so imprudently enterprised has so happily succeeded.

to make you amends. Ι see how much Ι am obliged to you for your '

hindness to me. Iudeed I don’t wonder at it, for it is no new thing,
and in that Ι am the more obliged to you. My Sapidus, Ι do, and it
is my duty to love you heartily for your lriudness to me. Inaamuch
as in this affair you have not acted the part of a courtier,I do, and
always shall thanlr you. Ι respect you, and thaulr you that you made
my affair your care You have obliged me very much by that kind-
