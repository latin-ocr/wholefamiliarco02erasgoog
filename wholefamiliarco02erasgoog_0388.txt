THE ssRAPfflc FUNERAL 381

man under an astonishment betwixt the hope of life and the faar of
death, and because profession does not obligo a man before the wearing
of the hood.

Pa Whether it be an obligation or no, it is certain they think it
one; and the resignation of the whole mind is aooeptable to Cod. And
this is the reason that the good works of monks, if we allow them to be
but equal with other persons, are more acceptable to God than those of
other men are, because they spring from the best root. Ph. Ishall
not here enter into the examination of tha merit of a man's dedicating
himself wholly to God when he is no longer in his own power. Ι take
it that every Christian delivers himself up wholly to God in his baptism,
when he renounces all the pompa and vanities of Satan, and lists him·
self a soldier to fight under Christ's banner all his life atter. And St.
Paul, speaking of those that die with Christ “that they may live no
longer to themselves, hut to Him that died for them,'' does not mean
this of monks only, but of Christiane universally.

Th. You have very seasonably put me inmind of baptism for in
times past, if they were hut dipped or sprinkled at the last gasp, there
was hope given them of eternal life. Pl. lt is no great matter what
the bishops promise 3 but it is a matter of great uncertainty what God
will do·; for if it were cert-ain that such men were presently made
citizens of heaven by having a little water sprinkled in their faces,
what greater gap could be laid open, that worldly- men might all their
life-long serve their filthy lusts and appetitos, and then get two or three
drops of water sprinkled upon them when they were not able to sin any
longerf Now, if the same rule holds ,in your profession and this
baptism, it is very well provided for the wioked, that they may not be
damned ; thetis, that they may live to the devil, and die to Christ.

rt. If it he lawful to divulge the seraphia mysteries, the profes· ν

sion of a Franciscanis more efficacious than baptism. Pl. What is
that you sayf Th. In baptism our sins are only washed away, and
the soul, though it be purged, is left naked3 but he that is invested
with this professionis presently enriched with the egregious merits of
the whole order, by being grafted into the body of the most holy
fraternity. Pt. Well, aad pray is he that is engratted into the body ,
of Christ never the better neither for the head nor tha bodyt Ta. He
is never the better for the seraphia body, unless he deserves it by some
special bounty or favour. Ph. Pray, from what angel had they this
revelationi Ta. Let me tell you, not from any angel, but Christ him·
self with His own mouth revealed this, and a great deal more to St.
Francis faceto face. Pl. Ι entreat you, if you have any kindness for
me, and I adjuro you, tell me what the discourses were. rt. These
are deep, profound mysteries, nor is it meet to commit them to profane Ι
ears. Pli. Why profane, my friend'l Inever wished better to any
order than to the seraphia. Pl. But you give them shrewd wipes
sometimes. Pl. This is a sign of love, Theotimus The greatest
enemies of the order are those professors of it, that by their ill lives
bringa scandat upon it And whosoever wishes well to the order can·
not but be offended with the con-upters of it.

fla But Ι am afraid St. Francis will be angry with me if I blah
any of his secreta. Pla What can you he afraid of from so harmiess
apersonl Tu What, why lost ho should striks me blind, or cause.
