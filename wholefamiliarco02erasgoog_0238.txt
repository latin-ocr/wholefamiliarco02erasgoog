Fu I suppose you would inser that as the mind sees and heere by
the eyes and ears, so by some organa it also understands‚ remembers,
loves, hates, is provoked and appeased. Eu. Rigbt. Fu But prsy,
whct are those organ's, and where are they situatedl Eu. Aa to the

sensible of the touch, unless when some member is seized with a
numbness Eu. When a fect is cut off, yet the mind understands.
Fa. It dces so, and when a hand is cut off too. Eu. A person that
receives e violent blow on the temples. or hinder part of his hecd fulls
down like one that is decd, and is insensible. Fu. I have sometimes
seen that myself.

Eu. Hence it ia to be collected, that the organa of the will, under·
standing, and memory ere placed within the skull‚ being not so crass
as the eyes end ears, and yet arc material, inasmuch as the most
subtil spirits that we have in the body are corporeal Fu. And can
they be vitiated with meat and drink tocl Eas. Yes Fa. The
brein is a great wey off from the stonracb. nu. And so is the sunnel
of a chimney from the firehearth, yet if you sit upon it you, will feel the
smoke. ra. I will not try that experiment. Eu. Well, if you
will not believe me, ask the storks And so it is of moment what
spirits and what wapours ascend from the stcmech to the brain, and
the organa of the mind For if these are crude or oold they stay in
the stomach. db. Pshaw! you are describing to, me an alemhic, in
which we distil simple waters

And that you may understand me the better, why have those that
guzzle a great deal of wine bad memoriesl Why are those that seed
upon light food not of so beavy a dispositioni Why does coriander
help the memoryl Why dces hellebore purge the memoryl Why
does a great expletion carrae an epilepsy, which at once brings a stupor
upon all the censes, as in a profound sleepl In the last place, as violent
thirst or want weaken the strength of wit or memory in boys, so food
caten immoderately makes boys dull-headed, if we believe Aristotle,
