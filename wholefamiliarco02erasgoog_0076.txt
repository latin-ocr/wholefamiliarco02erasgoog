THE PROFANE BANQUET. 69

do it too. The philosophare of our tiine are wiser who are content to
disputo like Stoica, bnt in living outdo even Epicurus himself. And
yet for all that, I look upon philosophy to be one of the most excellent
things in nature, if used moderately. Ι don’t approve of philosophising
too much, for it is a very jejune, barren, and melancholy thing. When
l fall into any calamity or sickness, then 1 betake mysclf to philosophy
as to a physioian 3 but when 1 arn well again l bid it farewell. Aa. Ι
like your method. Yon do philosophiae very well. Your humble
servant, Mr. Philosopher, notos tho Stoic school, but the kitchen.

Ob. What is the matter with you, Erasmus, that you are so
melancholyl What makes you look so frowninglyl What makes you
so silenti Are you angry with mc because Ι have entertained you
with such a slcnder supperl Er. N ay,l am angry with you that you
have put yourself to so much charge upon my account. Austin laid a
strict charge upon you that you would provide nothing extraordinary
upon his account. Ι believe yon have a mind we should never come
to see you agaiu3 for they give such a supper as this that intended to
make but one. What sort of guests did you expectl You seem to
have provided not for friends, but for princes. Do you think we are
gluttonsl This is not to entertain one with a supper, but victualling
one sor three days together. Cla You will baill-humourcd. Dispute
about that matter to-morrow3 pray bo good-humourod to-day. Wo
will talkabout tho charge to·morrow; I have no mind to hear any·
thing but what is merry atthis time.

Aa. Christian, whether had you rather have bees or muttonl
Cla Ι like bcef best, but I think mutton is the most wholesome. It is
the disposition os mankind to be most desirous of those things that uro
the most linrtiul. Aac. The French are wonderful admirere of pork.
ca. The French love that most that costs least. Aa. Ι am a J ew in
this one thing-thore is nothing I hate so much as swinc’s flosh. Ol.
Nor without reason, for what is more unwholesomcl ln this Ι arn not
ol the Frenclnnan’s, but of the Jew’s mind. Er. But Ι love both
mutton and pork, but for a different reason, for I eat frecly of rnutton,
because I love it 3 but hog's flesh I don't touch, by reason of love, that
lnray not give offenoe. cli. Yon are a elevor man, Erasmus, and a
very merry one too. Indeed Iam apt to wonder from whence it comes
to pass that thore issuoh a great diversity in men's palates, for if 1 may

. make use of this verse of Horace,—

Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur,
Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.

Er. Although, as the comedian says, So many men, so many
minds, and every man has his own way ; yet nobody can make me
believe there is more variety in men's dispositions than thero is
in their palates, so that yon can scarce find two that love tho saruc
things. Ι have seen a great many that cannot bear so much as the
amellos butten and cheese. Some loathe llesh, one will not eat roast
meat, and another will not eat boiled. There are many that prefer
water before wine. And more than this, which you will hardly

believe, Ihave seen a man who would ncither eat brcad nor driuk

wine. Oa. What did that poor man live onl Er. There was

nothing else but what he could cat-meat, fish, hcrbs, and fruit 01».
