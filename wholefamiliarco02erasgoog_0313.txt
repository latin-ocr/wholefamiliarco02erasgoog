³06 FAMILIAR OOLLOQUIES.

ofa feast ought to aot a movable part in the play. But then, again,
there is nothing more uncivil tlran to be continually talking of the sorte
of provision, the manner of dressing it, and what it eost you. It is the
same thing as to the wine. But you should rather modestly under·
velue the provision ς for if you undervalue it too much, it will be much
the same as if you were ostentatione concerning it lt is sufficient to
say twice, or at the most three times, Much good may it do you; and
though my entertainment is hut homely‚ your welcomo is hearty.
Sometimes you may break a jest‚ but such a one that has no teeth. It
will also be proper to hespeak every one, now and then, in his own ι
-tongue, hut in few words. But it now comes into my mind to speak

what Ι should have said at the beginning. Sp. What is itl
, Ap. If you have not a mind to place the guests by lot, take care to

Ι choose three out of the company that are of a diverting humour and

apt to talk, place one at the upper end of the table, another at the

, lower end, and a third in the middle, that they may keep the rest from

being either silent or melancholy. And if you perceive the company
grow either mute or noisy and inclinable to fall out—Sp. This is very
common with our countrymen; hut what must be done thenl Ap.
Then take the course that I have frequently experieuced to succeed.
Sp. Iwant to hear it. Ap. Bring in a couple of buffoons or jesters,
who by their gestures may express some argument without speaking
a word. Sp. But why without speakingl Ap. That the guests may
be all equally diverted, or, if they do speak, let them speak in a
language that none of them understands. By speaking hy gestures
they will ull understand alike. Sp. lcannot very well tell what you
mean hyan argument. Ap. There are a thousand-as suppose a wife
fighting with the husband for the breeches, or any other such comical
transaction in low life. And as to dandug, the more ridiculous it is the
more diverting it will be. These ought not to be above half-fools; for,
if they be downright idiote, they will, before they ure aware, foolishly
blab out what may give offenoe. Sp. As you have gived me good
advice, soI wish thatthe deity Comus may always hefriend ys. Ap.
I will conclude with this, or rather repeat what I said at first: Don’t
he too thoughtful to please everybody, not only in this affair, but in
any other circumstance of life, and that will he the way to please them

‘ the sooner; for it is a good maxim iu life, ‘⁶ 'l'oo much of oue thing is

good for nothing.”

rich and I handsome. Be. Why, then, do you account it so small a matter
to have a great namet Bo. Indeed I make vary small account of tha
name unless there be the thing too. Bc. But most men are of another
