when these fragments of obesse grew a little softer hy sosking and
seething, they alter the property. of the liquor that it is not then fair

water. Now this soup is served in aa a preparative for the stomaoh.
Ja. This was a soup for sowa. 002 And the next course is a pieoe of
atale tripe that has been boiled a fortnight Ja. Why, then, it must
needs stink Gi. It does stink, but they have a remedy for that too.
Ja. What is that, prayl Gi. Ι would tell you, but Ι am afraid you will
put it into practice. Ja. Ay, marry, sir! Gi. They would take an
egg and beat it up in warm water, and daub the tripe over with the
liquor 3 and so they put the cheat upon the eye, indeed, but cannot
cheat the nese, for the stink will force its way through all. If it hap
pened t‘o be a fishday, we had sometimes three whitings, and but small
ones neither, although there were seven or eight of us at table. Ja.
What, nothing elsel Gi. Nothing but that cheese as hard as a stone.

Ja. The oddest epicure I ever heard of. But how could so slender
provision be enough for so many guests of you, and especially not hav-
ing ate any breakfastl Gi. Well, to satisfy you, Ι tell you that the
remainder fed the mother-inlaw, the daughter-in-law, the youngest son,
a servantmaid, and a litter of children Ja. isay, now instead of
lessening, you have heightened my admiration Gi. Itis scarce pos·
sible for me to explain this difficulty to you, unless 1 first represent to
you in what order we sat at table. Ja Pray, represent it then Gi.
Autronius, he sat at the upper end of the table, and Ι sat athis right
hand, as being principal guest ; over against Autronius sat Orthrogonus 3

dine with us, he was placed accordingto his quality. As for the soup, g
there was no great danger oi its being eaten up, nor no great difference
in the messes, but only that in the dishes of· the principal guests there
were some bits of this cheese floating up and down. And besides,
there was a sort of barrieade made betwixt this soup by bottles of wine
and water, that none but three, before whom the dish stood, could
participate, unless he would be impudent indeed, end go beyond his
bounds. Nor did this dish stay long there, but was soon taken away,
that something might be left for the family.

Ju. What did the rest eat all this whilel Gi. They regaled
themselves after. their own fashion. Ja. How was thatl Gi. Why
they sopped the chalky bread in that sour dreggy wine. Jca Sure
your dinner used to be over in a minute. Gi. It ostentimes held
