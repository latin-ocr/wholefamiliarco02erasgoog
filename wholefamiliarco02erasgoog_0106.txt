tion, 0111101 out of 0 0000010000οε0 01 their lewd lives, or by reason of
scruplee that have been injected into their minde, even in their dying
1101110, by 001110 indiscreet men, die almost in despair.

Cle. Itis no wonder to find them die 00, who have spent their
time in philosophieing about ceremoniae 011 their lives. Nepa What
dc you mean by ceremoniesl Clt. Ι will tell yon, but with protesta-
tion over and over beforehand, that Ι (10 1101 find fault with the
sacramente and rites of the church, but rather highly approve of them ;
hut Ι blame a wicked and superstitious ecrt cf people, 01110 put it in
11100011001101111) the simple and unlearned persone, who teach people
to put their confidente in these things, omitting those things which
make them truly Christiane. N eph. Ι do not yet clearly understand
what it 10 you aim at.

ot. Iwill besplainer then. lf you look into Christiane in com·
mon, dcn’t you find they live ae if the whole sum of religion consisted
in ceremoniesl With how much pomp arc the ancient 11100 01 the
church set forth in baptisml The infant waits without the church
door, the exorcism 10 performed, the catechieing is performed, vows are
made, Satan ie abjured with all his pompe and pleaeures ; then the
child is ancinted, signed, eeasoned with salt, dipped, a charge given
to its euretiee to 00011 well brought up 5 and the oblaticn money being
paid, they are discharged, and by thie time the child pasees for a
Christian, and in 001110 0011001000. Α111110 time 0110111 ie ancinted
again, and in time learns to confess, receive the sacramentis accue-
tcmed to rest upon hely-days, to hear divine service, to fast sometimes,
to abetain from flceh, and if 110 observes all these he paeses for an
absolute Christian. He marries a wife, and then 0011100 011 another
sacrament ; he enters into holy orders, 10 ancinted again and conee-
crated, 1110 habitis changed, and then to prayere. Now I approve 01 ’
the doing of all this well enough; but the doing 01 1110111 111010 0111 01
00010111 than conscience Ι don't approve ; but 10 think that nothing else
is requisite for the making a Christian I absolutely disapprove.

For the greatest part of men in the world trust to these things,
arrd think they have nothing else to do but get wealth by right or
wrong to gratify their passione of rege, lust, malice‚ ambition. And
thie they do till they comc upon their deathbed; and then there ’
follows more ceremoniae—confession upon confession, more unction
still, the 00011011010 010 administered, tepere, the 01000, holy water are
brought in; indulgentes 010 procured, 11 they are to be had for love cr
money ; orders are given for a magnificent funeral ; and then comes
another solemn contract—whcn the 111011 10 111 the agouy cf death, there
ie 0110 stands by bawling in hie ear, and now and then dispatches him
before hie time, if he chance 10 be a little in drink, 01 have better
lunge than ordinary. Now although those things may be well enough,
as they are done in conformity to ecclesiastical customs, yet there are
001110 more internal impressione which have an efficacy to fortify us

, against the aesaults of death by filling our hearte with joy, and helping
’ us 10 go out of the world with a Christian aesurance.

Ea. Yon epealr very piously and truly; but in the meantime here
ie nobody cate. I told you before that you must expect nothing after
the second course, and that a country one too, leet anybody should
look 101 pheasante, mcor-hene, and 11110 kickehave. Here, boy! take
