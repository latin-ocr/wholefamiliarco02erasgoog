THE SERAPHIC FUNERAL. 387

moderated for two reasons, the one for sear they should troad upon
'money unewares, the other lest cold, or thorus, or snakes, or flint, or
any such thing should hurt them, since they are obliged to traval bare-
l'oot all the world over, But, however, that that might be, and the
dignity of the rule preserved inviolable, the slashes in the shoes show

Ph. They velue themselves much upon their pmfessing evangeliea}
perfectiori, which, they say, consiste in evangelical precepts; but about
those precepta the learned themselves have hot disputes And in
every state of life there is room sor evengelioal perfectiora But now,
which do you reckon the most perfect of the gospel preceptsl Τι. I
believe that you find in the fifth of Matthew, which ends thus, “ Lovo
your enemies, do good ιο them that hate you, and pray for those that
persecute you and revile you, that you may be the children of your
Father who is in heaven, who maketh His sun to shine upon the good
and the evil, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust : therefore
be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” Ph. You have
ι answered very pertinently3 but then our Father is rich and munificent ·

ιο all people‚ asking nothing of any man. ra. And so are they
bountiful ιοο ; but it is of spiritual things, of prayers, and good works,
in which they are very rich. Ph. Ι would there were among them
more examples of that evangelica] charity tbat returns blessings for
sminge, and good for evil.

What is the meaning of that celebrated saying of pope Alexander,
It is safer to affront the most powerful prinae than any one single
Franciscan or Dominican l ra Itis lawful to aveuge an injury offered
to the dignity of the order, and what is done to the least of them is done
ιο the whole order. Pla But why not rather the good that is done ιο
one is done to the whole orderl And why shall not an injury done to
one Christian engage all Christeudom in revengel Why did not
St. Paul, when he was beaten and stoned, call for succour against the
enemies of his apostolioal characterl Now if, according to the saying
of our Saviour, it be more blessed to give than receive, certainly he that
lives and teaches well, and gives of his own to those that are in want,
is much perfecter than he that is only on the receiving hand, or other-
wise st. Paul's boast of preaching the gospel gratis is vain and idle. Ιι
seems to me to be the best proof of an evangelical disposition that
persons are not angry when reproached‚ and have a Christian charity
for those that ill deserve it. What great matter is it for a man ιο
relinquish something of his own, to live better upon that which is
another body’s, and to reserva ιο himself a desire of revengel The
world ie full everywhere of this half-ahod, ropegirt sort of people ; but
there is soarce one of them ιο be found that presses after that which
Christ calls perfectiori, and the apostles constantly praetised.

rt. I am no stranger to the stories that wicked persons tell of
them; but, for my own part, wherever I see the sacred habit Ι think
the angele of God are by, and count that a happy house whose threshold
is most worn by their feet. Pla. And Ι am of opinion that women are
nowhere more fruitful thau where these men are mest familiar. But Ι
beg St. Francis's pardon, Theotimus, sor being so much out of the way.
