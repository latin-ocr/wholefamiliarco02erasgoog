THE LYJNsIN WOMAN. 231

ancients did not think fit to call them so, and we must not devicte from
their ordinantes, nor does it signify much as to what we are upon

Fa But I cannot hear the thoughts of it, that the soul of a beetle
andos a men should be the same. Ea. Good maclam, it is not the
same, saving in some respects; your soul animates, vegetatos, and
renders your body sensible3 the soul ot the beetle animatos his body:
tor thet some things act one way, and some another, that the soul of a
man acts differently from the soul of a beetle, partly proceeds from the
matter; a beetle neither sings nor speaks, because it wants organs fit
t'or these actions. Fra Why, then, you say, that 11 the soul os a beetle
should pass into the body ot a man, it would act as the burnan soul
does. Ec. N ay, I say not, if it were an angelical soul. And there
is no differente between an angel and a human soul, but that the soul
os a man was formed to act a human body composed of natural orgens;
and as the soul of a beetle will move nothing but the body of a beetle,
an angel was not made to animate a body, but to be capable to under*
stand without bodily organa Fra (lan the soul do the same thingt
uu. It ean, indeed, when it is separated from the bodyt Fa. Is it
not at its own disposal while it is in the bodyt ea. No, indeed,
except something hoppen beside the common course ot* nature.

Fa. In truth, instead of one soul you have given me a great many
-an animal, a vegetative, a sensitive, an intelligent, a remembering, a
willing, an angry, and desiring: one was enough sor me. ru. There
are different actions of the same sorrl, and these have different names.
Fa. I do not well understand you. aa Well, then,1 will make you
understand me You are a wife in the bed-chamber, in your workshop
a weaver of hangings, in your warehouse a seller ot them, in your
kitehen a noch, among your servants a mistress, and among your
children a mother; and yet you are all these in the same house. Fa.
You philosophiae very bluntly. · Is, then, the soul so in the body as I
am in my houset Bra It is lta. But whileI am weaviug in my
workshop I am not cooking in my kitehen. 116, Nor are you all
soul, but a soul carrying about a body, and the body cannot be in many
places at the same time; but the soul, being a simple form, is so in the
whole body, though it does not eet the same in all parts of the body,
· nor atter the same manner, how differently affected soever they ere
For· it understands and remembers in the hrain, it is angry in the
beart, it lusts in the liver, it hears with the ears, sees with the eyes,
smells with the nose, it testes in the palate and tongue, and feels in all
the parts of the body which are adjoined to any nervous part. But it
does not leel in the bair, nor the ends of the neils ; neither do the
lunge feel ot themselves, nor the liver, nor perhaps the milt neither.
Fa. So that in certain parts of the body it only aufinates and vegetatos
Ea It should seem so.

db. If one and the mme soul does all these things in one and the
same man, it follows of consequence th'at the foetus in the womb of the
mother both feels and understands as soon as it begins to grew, which
is a sign ot life, unless a man in his formation has more souls than one,
and afterwards the rest giving place, one acts all. So that at first a
manis a plant, then an animal, and lastly a man. Era Perhaps
Aristetle would not think what you say absurd: 1 think itis more

probable that the rational soul is infused with the lite, end that, like a
