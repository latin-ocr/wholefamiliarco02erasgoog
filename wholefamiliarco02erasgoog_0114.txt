hare the types and propheciae of the Old Testament, especially out of
the prophets and Psalms, which are little else but the life of Christ and

apostles related another way. Here I sometimes walk discoursing with
myself, and meditating upon the unspeaknble counsel of (lod, in giving
’ His Son for the redemption of mankind. Sometimes my wife bears me

learned to live by himself. Upon the upper border (as though not fit
to be among the rest) arc all thepopes’ heads, with their titles, and
over against them the heads of the Casars, for the better taking in the
order of history. At each corner there is a lodging mom, where Ι can
repose myself and have a prospect of my orchard and my little birds.

Here, in the farthest nook of the meedow, is a little banqueting-
house3 there I sup sometimes in summer, and 1 make use of it asan
infirmary, if any of my family he taken ill with any infectious disease.
Ti. Some people are of opinion that those diseases are not to be
avoided. Ea. Why then do men shun a pit or poisonl Or do they
sear this the less besam they do not sec itt No more is the poison
seen that a basilisk darts from his eyes. When necessity calls for it, Ι
would not stick to venture my life; hut to do it without any necessity
is rashness.

There are some other things worth your seeing, but my wife shall'
shew you them. Stay here this three days, if you plesse, and make my
house your home; entertain your eyes and your minda, I have a little
business abrocdz I must ride out to. some of the neighbouring towns.
Ti. What! a money businessl Eu. Iwould'not leave such friends
for the sake of receiving a little money. Τι’. Perhaps you have
appointed a hnnting match. ea. It is a kind of hunting, indeed3
but it is something else I hunt than either boare or stage. ri. What
is it thenl Eu. Ι will tell you. Ihave a friend in one town lies
dangerously ill; the physioian fears his life, but I am afraid of his soul.
For I don't think he is so well prepared for· his end as a Christian
should be. lwill go and give him some picus admonitione that he
may be the better for whether he lives or dies In another town there
are two men bitterly at odds; they are not ill men either, hut men of
a very obstinate temper. If the matter should rise to a greater height,
I am afraid it would be of ill consequence to more than themselves Ι
will do all I can in the world to reconcile them-they ere both my
kinemen This is my hunting match, and if Ι shall have good success
in it we will drink their healths st. A very picus hunting, indeed,
we pray heartily that not Delia but Christ would give you good success.
Eu. I had rather obtain this prey than have two thousand ducats left
me for a legacy. Τι’. Will you ¹come back quicklyl Eu. Not tillI
have tried everything; therefore I cannot set a time. In the mean3
time, be as free with anything of mine as though it were your own, and,
enjoy youyrselvca Ti. God be with you forward and backward.
