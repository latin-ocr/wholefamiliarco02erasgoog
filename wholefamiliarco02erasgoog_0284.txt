ldHFHFOPHAGIA3 oa, Fran-arratis. 277

Bu. Very cleverly answered indeed Ι But there were sons under
the Mosaic law, and there are now servants under the gospel3 and Ι
am afraid the greatest part of mankind are so if they are servants who
do their duty by compulsiou. What difference is there then between
the new dispensation and the oldl Fi. A great deal in my opinion:
because the old taught under a veil, and the new is laid open to view3
that which the old forctold by parables and riddlcs the new explains .
clearly 3 what that promised darlrly, this exhibite for the most part
manifestly: that was given to one nation singly, this equally tcaches
all the way of salvation 3 that imparted that notable and spiritual
grace to a few prophete and famous men, but this largely sheds abroad

Where are those gifts now'l Fi. They are ceased, but not lost, either
because there is no need of them now the doctrine of Christ is spread
abroad‚ or else because many are only Christiane in name, and we
want saith. which is the workcr of miracles.

Bu. If miracles are necessary on account of unbelierers Ι am sure
the world is full of them now. Fi. This is an unbelief simply erring,
such as that of the Jews murmuring against Peter because he had
received Cornelius’s family into the grace of the gospel3 and such as
was that os the Gentiles, who thought the religion they had received
from their ancestors was sufficient to salvation, and the apostles'
doctrine to be estrange superstition: these were converted by seeing
miracles, But now those that believe not the gospcl when it sirines
so gloriously through the whole world, do not err simply, but being
blinded by their evil affectione, will not understand that they may
do what is good3 such as these no miracles would reduce to a better
mind. And now is the time of hcaling, but the time of punislring
will corne.

Bu. Indced you have said many things that have a probability in

them 3 however, Ι am resolvcd not tc depend upon the judgmcnt of a ·

sirltfishmonger 3 but Ι will go tc some divine, eminent for learning,
and what hc says concerning all these things I will believe. Fi. erol
Plraretriusl Bu. He dotes before he isold, and is fit to preach to
none but doting old women. Fi. Well,tl1en‚whatl Bliteusl Ba.
Do you think 1 will give any credit to a prating scplristl Fi. Well,
then, Amphicholusl Ba. Ι will never trust him to answer questions
that never answered my demands for the meat I trusted him. Can he
resolve hard questions that was always insolvent as to his dcbtsl
Fi. Wlm, tlrenl Lernantiusl Bu. I shall not clroose a blind man to
ehew mc the way. Fi. Who, theul Bu. lf you have a mind to
know, it is Cephalus, a man very well versed in three languagm, aad
accomplished with all good literature, farniliarly acquainted with the
sacred scriptores and ancient fathers. Fi. 1 will advise you better:
gato the Elysian shades, and there you will find Rabin Druin, hc will
cut all your knotty questions in two with a pair of shears. Bu. Do
you go before and clear the way.

Fi. But, setting aside jesting, is that true you told me of a

dispensation for flesh-eatingl Bu. No,I did but joke with you to

tease you And if the pope had ever so much mind to do it, you

lishmongers would raise mohs about it. And besides, the world is full
