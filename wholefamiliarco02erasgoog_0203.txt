the most precious thing of all, the fruit of which will bear us company
i nuto another lifel Aut. Ι have often heard it said that a wisc woman
·! is twice a fool. M ap. That indeed has been often said, but it was by
ἕ fools A woman that is truly wise does not think herself so. But on
· the contrary, one thet knows nothing, thinks herself to be wisc, and
ἑ that is being twice a fool. ma I cannot well tell how it is, that as
panniers do not become an ox, so neither does learning become a woman.
May. But, Ι suppose, γοα cannot deny but panniers will look better
upon an ox than a mitre upon an ass or a sow.
What think γοα of the Virgin Msryf Ant. Very highly. May.
Was not she bookishl Ant. ch 3 but not as to such books as these.
May. What books did she readl Aret. The canonicul hours. Mag.
For the use of whomi Aut. Of the order of Benedictines May.
Indeedl What did Paula and Eustochium dol Did not they con-
verse with the Holy Scriptures'l Aut. Ay, but this is a rare thing
now. Mag. So was a blockheaded abbot in old times3 but now
nothing is more common. In old times princes and emperors were as
eminent for learning as for their governmonts. And after all, it is not
so great a rarity as you think it. There are both in Spain and Italy
not a few women that are able to vie with the men, and there are the
Morites in England, and the Bilihaldduks and Blaureticks in Germany.
So that unless γοα take care of yonrselves it will come to that pass
that we shall be divinity professore in the solicola, and preach in the
churches, and take possession of your mitres. Ant. (lod forbid.
Mag. Nay, it is your business to forbid it For if yon hold on as you
have begun, even gesse themselves will preach before they will endure
you, a parcel of dumb tcachers. You aee the world is turned upside
down, and you must either lay aeide your dress or perform your part.
χ· Ant. How came Ι to fall into this woman's company? If you will
come to see me, Ι will treet you more pleasantly. Moy. After what
mannerl Aut. Why, we will dance and drink heartily, and hunt,
and play, and laugh. May. Icen hardly forbear laughing now.
