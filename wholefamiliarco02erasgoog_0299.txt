Ma. How many doctore had hel Pe. Sometimes ten, sometimes
twelve‚ but never under six. Ma Enough, in conscience, to have done
the business of a man in perfect health. Pb. As soon as ever they
had got their money they privately binted to some of his near relations
that his death was near at hand, and that they should take care of the
good of his seul, forthere was no hope of his recevery; and this was
handsomely intimated by some of his particular friends to the sick man
himself, desiring him that he would commit the care of his body to

George, hearing this, looked wonderful sourly at the physicians,
taking it very heinously that they should leave him now in his distress.
They told him that physicians were but men, and not gods, and that
they had dene what art could do, but there was no physic would
avail against fate, and so went into the next chamber. Mu What
did they stay fer after they were paidl Pla They were not yet

the siek man had confessed to the Franciscan‚ did point blank refusa
to give him either the extreme unction, the eucharist, or afford him a
