PREFAOE.

——n—fi—

Manrcrous detraction, attended with the Furios, does at this day so
rage throughout the whole world, that it is unsafe to publish any book
except it be defended by a guard. Although what, indeed, can be secure
enough from the sting of a false accuser, who, like the adder at the voice
of the charmer, steps his ear from hearing any one clearing himself,
though it be ever so justlyl The first part of this work, which is mine
and not mine, was published by reason of the rashness of a cemain
man ; which, when I perceived it was received by the studente with
great applause‚ Ι made use of the affection of the common people for
the furtherance of studies. And so physicians themselves do not
always administer the most wholesome things to their patients, but
permit them to take some things because they have a very strong
desire for them. So, in like manner, I thought meet to allure tender
youth with euticements of this sort, who are more easily attracted with
those things that are pleasant than those that are serious or the most
exact. ThereforeI have again corrected that which was published‚
and besides have added such things as may conduco to the forming of
good manners, as it were insinuating into the minds of young persons,
whom Aristotle accounted not to be fit auditors of moral philosophy—
viz, such as is delivered in serious precepta. And if any one shall
cry out that it is an unseemly thing for an old man to sport himself
thus childishly, Ι care not how childishly it be, so it be but profitably.
And if the ancient teaclrers of children are commended who allured
thern with wafers, that they might be willing to learn their first rudi·
ments, Ι think it ought not to be charged as a fault upon me, that hy
the like regard I allure youths either to the elegancy of the Latin
tongue or to piety. And besides, it is a good part of prudente to

know the foolish affectione of the common people and their absurd ἱ

opinions. Ι judge it to be much better to instruct those out of this
little book, than by experience, the mistress of fools. The rules of
grammar are crabbed things to many persons. Aristotle's Moral
Philosophy is not fit for children. Scotus’s Divinity is less fit, nor is
it, indeed, of any great use to mento procare thom understanding.
And it is a matter of great moment early to disseminate ateste of the
best things into the tender minds of children, and I cannot tell that
anything is learned with better success than what is learned by play-
ing ; and this is in truth a very harmless sort of fraud to tricka
person into his own profit Physicians are commended for cheating
their patients after this manner 3 and yet if Ihad done nothing else
in this 'matter but trifled, they might seem to have horne with me,
because besides the elegancy of the language, I have inserted some
things that may prepare the mind for religion. They accuse me
falsely3 and es though the principles of the Christian religion were
here seriously set down, they examine every syllable exactly. How
