Pl. So sar from it, that this storm uvas no sooner laid than a worse
followed. Ma Upon what ground, prayl Po. I will tell you.
Thero were four orders of begging sriars in the house already, and
now in comes a fifth of crosa-beurere, against which all tho other four
orders riso up in a tumult, as illegitimate and spurious, saying, Where
did you eversae a waggon with five wheelsl or with what sace would
they rcokon more orders of mendicante than there were evangelista?
At this rute ye may even as well call in all the beggars to you from
the bridgcs and erosa-ways Μ a. What reply made the crosa-bearem
to thiel Ph. They ashed thern how the waggon of the ohuroh went
before there were any mendicante at alll arrd so after that, when there
was but one order, and then again when there were thrael As for the
number of the evangelists, say they, it has no more affinity with our
orders than with the die for having on every side four angles. Pmy,
who brought the Augustines or carmelites into the orderl When did
Austin or Elias go a beggingt for they make them to be principale
of their order. These und a great deal more they thundered out
violently; but being overpowered with numbers of the four orders,
they could not stand the charge, hut were soreed to quit the ground,
but threatening them with dreadful things.

posititious. This contentiori rose to that height, that Iwas afraid it
would have come to blows. Ma. And could tho sick man endure all
thiel Pu. They were not in his bed-chamber now, but in a court
that joined to it, but· so that he could hear every word they said 3 sor
there was no whispering, believe me, but they very fairly exercised
their lunge. Besides, men, as you know, are quicker of hearing than
ordinary in sickness. Mo. But what was the end of this disputet
Po. Why, tho sich man sent them word by his wife that if thoy would
but hold their tongues a little he would setall to rights; and therefore
· desired that the Augustines and Carmelitcs should go away for the
present, and that they should be no losers by it, for they should have

the same portion of meat sent them home that those had that ataid -

there. He gave direction that all the five orders should assist at his

funeral, and that every one of them should have an equal share of
