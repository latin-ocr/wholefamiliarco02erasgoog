They replied, Arrest him in an action of assault and battery. A
loolish story, indeed, says he. What, says he, suppose an ass had given
me a kick, must Ι sue him upon the same action, and subpoeua you for
evidences os the injury offeredl intimating that that sarrcy fellow was
no better thau an ass, and that it was the part of a mean soul not ιο
be able to bear such an affront from a nnmskull as he would from a
brute animal. The Roman history is not so well stored with instantes os
moderatiori, nor so remarkable 3 for, in my opinion, he does not deservo

said when Lentulus spit in his faceand threw snot in it. He said
nothing to him but this, Hereafter Ι shall have an answer ready for
them that shall say, You are a man that have no mouth (Os), for the
