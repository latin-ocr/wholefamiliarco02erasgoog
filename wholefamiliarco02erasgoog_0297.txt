290 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES

wear an asheoloured habitanda canvas girdle ; but compare their
lives, and nothing can he more disagreeable ε Ι speak of a great many,
. but not of all. And this may be carried through all orders and profes·
sions. A preposterous confidence springs from an erroneous judgment,
and from them both, preposterous seandals. Lot but a Franciscan go
out of doors with a leather girdle, if he has chanced ιο lose his rope,
or au Augustino with a woollen one, or one that uses to wear a girdle
without one, what an abomination would it be accountedl What
danger is there, that if some women should see this they would miscarry 1
And from such trifles as these, how is brotherly charity broke in upon 1
what bitter envyings‚ how viruleut slanderings! The Lord exclaims
against thplse in tpe ςιέζρέι, and so does Paul vehemently, 'and so ought
vines an reae ers o.

Fi. Indieed they ought ιο do so 3 but there are a great many among
them whose interest it is to have people, princes, and bishops such as
they are themselves And there are others again that have no more
sense as to these things than the people themselves, or if they do
know better, they dissemble it, consulting their own hellies rather than
the interest of «Iesus Christ. And hence it comes to pass, that the
people being everywhere corrupted with erroneousjudgments, are secure
where there is danger, and feartul where there is noue; can sit down
satisfied where they should proceed, and go forward when they should
return. And itamar attempt to bring any one off from these erroneous
principles, presently they cry out sedition, as though it were sedition
for any one with better remedies to endeavour ιο correct a vicious habit ’
of body, which an ignorant pretender to physic has for a long time

. nourished, and almost brought it to be natural. But it is time to leave off

these complaints, forthere is no end of thern. And if the people should
hear what discourse we have, we are in danger to have a new proverb
raised upon us, that a saltfishmonger and ahutcher trouble their heads
about such things.

Bo. If they did,I would return this proverb upon them, Sceps

lousy, stern, old, withered, white-livered fellow 3 he had scaros three
hairs on his head, and whenever he opened his mouth he shut his eyes;
they said he was a divine, and he called me a disciple ofAntiohrist, aud
a great many such like things. Fi. What did you do thenl Did you

stinkiug brain, if he had any. Fi. Ι should be glad to hear the whole
of that story. Bu. So you shall, if you will come and dine with me
on Thursday next; you shall have a veel-pie for dinner, so tender
baked that you may suck it through a quill. Fi. I will promise you

vince you that we fishmongers do not live merely on stinking salt fish.
