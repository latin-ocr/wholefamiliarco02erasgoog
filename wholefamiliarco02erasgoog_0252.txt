are neither pure nor virgin ones. 09. As soon as the officer sees us,
he runs presently and puts on a surplice and a stole about his neck,
and falls down very devoutly and worships, and by and by gives us
the holy milk to kiss. Then we prostrated ourselves at the lowest
step of the altar, and having first paid our adcretion to Christ, we
applied ourselves to the Virgin in the following prayer, which we had
framed beforehand for this very purpose :-

“Virgin Mother, who hast merited to give suck to the Lord of
heaven and earth, thy Son J esus, from thy virgin breests, we desire ’
that, being purified by H is blood, we may errive at that happy iniant
state oi dove-like innocence which, being void of malice, fraud, and
deecit, we may continually desire the milk of the evangelical doctrine,
until it grows up to a perfect man, and to the measure oi the fulness of
Christ, whose blessed society thou wilt enjoy for evermero, with the
Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen.”

Me. Truly, a devout prayer. But what answer did she makel
Op. If my eyes did not deceive me, they were both pleased, for the
hely milk seemed to give a leap, and the eucharist scemed to look
somewhat bigger than usual. In the meantime the shower of the
relies came to us, without speaking a word, holding out such a kind ol'
table as they in Germany that take toll on the bridges hold ont to

After this, by our interpreter (if I remember right), one Robert
Aldridge, a well-spoken young man, and a great master of the English
tongue, l inquired as civilly as Ι could, what assurance he had that
this was really the Virgin's milk. Arrd truly I desired to be satisficd

pressed the interpreter to put the same question to him again, but in
the fairest manner that could be, and he did it in so ohliging a manner
thetis hehad addressed himself to the mother herself in these terras,
when she had but newly lain in, she would not have taken it amisa.
But the officer, as if he had been inspired with some enthusiasm‚ look-
iug upon us with astonished eyes, aud with a sort of horror, cur-sing
our blasphemous expression, said, What need is there ior your putting
this question, when you have an authentis recordl and had turned
us out oi deors for heretics, had not a few ponec pacified his rago.

Me. But how did you behave yourselves in the interimi Op.
J nst as ii we had been stunned with a cudgol, or struck with thundcr ;
we sneaked away, humbly begging his yrardon for our boldness ; for
so a man ought todo in holy matters. Thence we went to the little
chapel, the dwelling of the Virgin Saint. In our way thither an
expounder of sacred things, one of the minors, offers himself ; he stares
upon us as if he had a mind to draw our pictures; and having gone a
little further, another meets us, staring upon us after the same manner3
and after him a third. Me. lt may be they had a mind to have
drawn your picture. Op. But Ι suspected far otherwise. Mc. What
did you imagine thenl Op. That some sacrilegious person had stolen
some of the Virgin’s vestments, and that I was suspected aa the thiel.
