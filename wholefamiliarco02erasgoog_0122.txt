father his life too, for all he was aman 01 0 strong constitution. Mo.
May not a person know her mothefs 11011101 Ρα. Yes, Sophrona,
everybody knows her name. What do you 1110011 by that questioni
Do you think 1 invent a 1101 Ma. Why should I think so 01 youl
Our sex is most to bo suspected for that. But tell 1110 what became of
the maidt

Pa. The maid, as I told you before, came 01 very honest parents,
had a good fo1tune, was very handsome, and in few words, was a match
101 a princej a certain gentleman of an equal fortune courted her.
lla. What was his namet Pa Ah, me, Ioannot bear the thoughts 01
it ; his name was Pamphilus as well as 1111110. He tried all the ways
in the world tc gain her good will 3 but she slighted all his offers.
The young man pines away with grief. Presently after she fell deep
in love with one more like an ape than 0 man. Ma. Howl Po.
Ay, 00 wretchedly in love, that it is impossible to relate it. Mo.
Such a pretty maid to fall in love with such an ugly fellowl Pa. Ay,
with a long-visaged‚ scald-headed, bald-pated, hollow-eyed, snubnosed,
wide-mouthed, rotton-toothed, stuttering, scabby-bearded,humpbacked,
gorbellied, bandy-legged follow. Mo. Yon tell me of a mere Thersites.
Po. Nay, they said he had but 0110 ear neither. lla. It may he he
had lost theother in the war. Pa No, he lost it in peace. Mea
Who dared to cut it 0111 Pa. Jack Ketch. Ma. It may be his
riches made amends. Po. Over head and ears in debt. And with
this husband this charming girl now spends her days, and is now and
then drubbed inte the bargain. Ma. That is a miserable story indeed.
Po. But it is a true one. It is a just retaliation upon her for slight·
ing the young gentleman Mo. I should rather choose to be thunder·
struck than tied to endure such n husband.

Po. Then do not provoke justice, but love him that loves you.
. llo. Well, if that will do, I dolove you again Po. Ay, but Ι would
‘have that love constant as mine own. I 001111 a wife, not a mistress.
Mo. I suppose so, but yet we ought to be very deliberate in that which
being once done can never be undone again. Po. I have been
deliberating too long already. Ma Love is none 01 the best advisere 3
see that he has not imposed upon you, for they say he is blind. Pa.
But that love has eyes in his head that proceeds from judgment; you
donet appear so amiable only because Ι love you, but you are really
so, and therefore I love you. Mo. But perhaps you do not know me
thorcughly. When once a shoe is 011, then you will know where it
pinches. Pa. I will venture it; but I gather from many conjectures
that it will be happy for me. Ma. What, are you an augur thenl
Pa. Yes, Iam.

Mo. Pray by what auguries do you prognosticate all this 1 What,
hath the nightowl appeared luckily'l Po. She flies 101· 10010. Mo.
Did you see a pair 01 pigeons 011 your right handl Po. Nothing of
all this 3 but have for some years been satisfied 01 the honesty of your
father and mother, and in the first place, that is no bad sign. Nor
am Ι ignorant how modestly and religiously you have been brought up
hy them, and it is a greater advantage te be honestly educated than
honourahly born And then there is another good circumstance
besides, that ss my parents are none 01 the worst, so yours and mine
have been very intimate 101 many years, and you and Ι have known
