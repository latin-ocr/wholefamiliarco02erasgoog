Cu. Why isa 10011 man heavier 111011 0101 man, supposiug 1110111
both of an equal sizel Al. Because bones are more solid than flesh,
and therefore the more weighty. Ca. Whyisthe same manheavier when
he is 10011113 than after he has 010 his dinner, and so added a weight to
his body. Al. Because by meat and drink the spirits are increased,
and they add a lightness to the body ; and hence it is that a merry
man is heavier than a sorrowful one, and a dead man 111011 a living 0110.
Oa. But how is it that the same man 0011 make himself heavier or
lighter when he pleasesl Al. By holding 111 his breath he makes
himself lighter, and by breathing it out heavier 3 soa bladder when
blown, and 01000 tied, swims, but when it is burst, sinks. But when
will Orrrio have done asking questions?

Cu. Ι will leave off if you will tell 1110 but a few things morel Is
1110 heaven heavy or lightl Al. I cannot tell whether it be light or
no, but Ι am sure it cannot be heavy, it being of the 1101111001 1110.
Ca. What 111011 does 1110 old proverb mean, What 11 1110 sky should
falll Al. Because 1110 ignorant ancianis, following Homer, believed
the heaven 1ο be made of iren, but Homer called it 11011 from the
similitude 01 0010111, not 01 11013111, 00 we call that ashy that is 01 the
0010111 01 ashes. (lu. Is there any colour in the skyl 111. Τ11010 10
1101 really any eolour in it ; but it appears so to us, because 01 1110 011
and water that is betwixt us and it 5 as the sun sometimes aprpoars to
us to be red, sometimes yellow, sometimes white, when 01 110011 11
admits 01110 such mutations. In like manner 1110 00101110 01 the roin-
bow 010 not in 1110 sky but in the moist air.

Cu. But 1011111110 011 end; you confess there is nothing 11131101 than
the heaven, which way soever it covers tha orb 01 the earth. Al. I do
0011100000. Oa. Α11111101111113110011011110111110001111οο1 1110001111. nl.
No. Cu. 01 011 things 111 the world what is the heaviestl 111. Gold, in
my opinion. ’ [Ca. I differ very much from you in this point. Al. Why,
do you know 01 anything thetis lreavier than goldl Ca. Yes, Ι do,
and by many degrees 100. 111. Τ11011 now do you take your turn and
teach 111ος 101Ι profess Ι do not know anythiug that is. Cu. Must
not that needs be 1110 heaviest thing in 1110 world that forced down
the fiery spirits from the very vortex of heaven to the bottom 01 110111
and that (you know) is placed in the 0011110 01 the 001111. 111. I confess
it3 but what is thatl Cu. Sin, which plunges the scula of mcn, that
Virgil calls sparks of pure ether, 10 1110001110 place. At. If you have
a mind to pass 10 that sort 01 philosophy, Ι 00111000 both gold and lead
10 be as light as feathcrs compared to it. Ca. How then 0011 they
that 010 laden with this 0011 01 11133030 mount up 10 1101110111 Αἰ. ln
truth I cannot tell. Cu. They that prepare themselves for running
or leaping do not only lay aside all lreavy things, but make themselves
light by holding 111 their breathy when as to the 1000 and leap that we
take to heaven we do not endeavour 1ο throw aside that which 10
heavier than stone or lead. Al. Ay, but we should doit ifwehad

but one 310111 ofsound judgment.
