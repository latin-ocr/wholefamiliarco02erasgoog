THE LoVaa ΑΝΙ) MAIDEN. , 113

first place, 1 think yon will grant me this, that death is only 0 separa
tion ol soul and body. Ma. Igrant it. Po. But you must grant it
scas not to eat your words. Ma. No, I will not. Po. You will
not deny, Ι suppose, that the person that takes away another's life is 0
murderer. Mo. I grant that too. Pa. lsuppose you will grant that
which has been allowed by the greatest men of many ages, that the
soul of a man is not really where it animatos, hut where it loves. Ma.
Mako that a little plainer,l cannot well understand it then. Pa.
You might as well bid me make an adamant sensible of it Ma. Ι
am a maid, not a stone. Pa. Itis true, but harder than an adamant
stone. Ma. Goon with your inferences. Pa. These that are in a
trance do neither hear, nor see, nor 0111011,1101100111100111111110111
outright. Mo. Indeed Ι have heard so. I'o. Whatdo you think
is the reasonl Ma. Do you, philosopher, toll that. Pa. Because
their mind is in heaven, where it enjoys what it clearly loves, and
therefore is absent from the body. Ma, Well, what thenl Pa.
What then, hard-hearted creaturel Then it follows that Ι am dead,
and you have killed me. Mo. Where is your soul thenl Pa.
Where it loves. Mo. Who took this aoul of yours awayl What do
you sigh forl Tell me freely: there is no hurt in it. Pa. A oruel
maid, that Ι could not be angry with if she killed 1110 'outright Ma
, You are very good humoured ; but why do not you take her soul srorn
her too, and pay hor in her own eoin, according to theold proverb.
Po. Ishould be the happiest man in the world il l could make that
exchangc that hor heart would pass as wholly into my breast as mine
has into her‘s

Ma. But may I play the sophist with you nowl Pa. The sophist
ress. Mo. Can ono and the same body be both alive and deadl
· Po. Not at the same time. Mo. Is the body dead when the soul
is out of itl I'o. Yes. Ma. Nor does it animate it, but when it
is in itl Po. N ο, it does not. Mo. How comes it to pass then,
that when it is there where it loves, it yet animatos the body it is gone
out of l And if it animatos when it loves anywhere, how is that
called a dead body which it animatesl Po. Indeed, you argue very
cunningly, but you shall 1101 catch me there. That soal, which after
some sort gouer-ns the body of the lover, is but irnproperly called a .
. soul, when it is but sorno small remains of the soul, just astho small
of a rose remains in the hand when the rosc 'aa gone. llo. I see it is
a hard matter to catch a fox in a trap. But answcr me this quaestion,
does nottho person that kills actl I'a. Yes. Mo. And does not
he suffer who is killedt Pa Yes. Ma. And how comes it about,
then, that when ho tha-t loves acts, and she that is loved suffers, she
that is loved should be said to kill, when he that loves rather kills
> himself l Pa. Nay, on the contrary, it is he that loves that suffers,
and she is loved that acts. Mo. You will never prove that by all
yourgmengr.do Ξαῇᾝᾏξ1111111111νὲὲῂ11101101111101100, do you
love voluntarily, or against your willl Pa. Voluntarily. Mo. -
Thea, since 0 person is at liberty whether he will 1010 orno, he that

does love is guilty of selo de ae, and accuses a maid wrongfully. Pa.
A maid does not kill in being loved, but in not loving again. He is
guilty ol killing that ean 0010 and does not save. Mo. Whatis a
