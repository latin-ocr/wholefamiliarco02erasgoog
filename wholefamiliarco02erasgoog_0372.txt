imitation the men that have been celebrated by the pens of all men,
such as Aristides, Phocion, Socrates, Epaminondas, Scipio Africanus,
(lato Senior, and Cato of Utica, and Marcus Brutus, and the like, who
both .by war and peace studied to deservo aa well as possible of the
commonwealth. ,This is the fertile field of glory. Ph. But among
those famous meu, Aristides suffered banishment for ten years, Phocion.
and Socrates drank poison, Epaminondas was aecused of treason, and
so was Scipio 3 Cato the Elder being acoused was obliged to plead forty
times in his own defence; Cato of Utica killed himself, and so did
Brutus. But 1 would have glory without envy. Sy. Ay, but thetis
more than Jupiter granted even to Hercules himself 3 for after he had
tamed so many monsters, last of all he had Hydra to engage with, and
that was the longest engagement of them all. Pu. Iwould neither
envy Hercules the glories of his labeum, I only account them happy
men that obtain a good name not sullied with envy.

Sy. I perceive you would have a pleasant life, and for that resson
are afraid of envy 5 nor arc you in the wrong, for that is one of the
worst of monsters. Pl. It is so. Sy. Then live a private life.
Pa. But that is to be dead, and not tc live. Sy. 1 understand what
you would be at; you would walk in the sun and have uo shadow.
Ph. That is impossible. Sy. And so it is equally impossible to obtain Α
glory and ΒΘ free from envy3 glory accompanies well-doing, and so does
envy glory. Pa. But the old comedian tells us that glory may be with·
out envy, saying, Ite ut facillime aas iavideb laudm invenies et etnicos
parea Sy. If you will be content with that praise which young

Pu. Many persons have a mighty affection for youth, and so it is
no hard matter to obtain auch praise as that. That which I would
have is a certain gloriousness of name that should ring all the world
over, that should increase in illustriousness as Ι do in age, and be most
renowned aiter my death. Sy. I commend the greatness of your
mind, Philodoxus; but if you are ambitione of a glory that proceeds
from virtue, it is the chiefest virtue to be regardless of glory, aud the
highest commendation not to aspira aiter prsise, which follows them
nrost that endeavour to shun it. 'I'herefore you ought to take care,
lest the more strenuoualy you pursue it, the more you be frustrated of
it. Pa. I am not an insensible Stoi03 Iam subject to human affec·
