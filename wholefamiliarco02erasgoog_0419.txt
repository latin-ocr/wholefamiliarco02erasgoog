whom you throw your reflections upon.

Th. You may thank your companions there for your grandeur.
Ba. What, thesei Th. Yes, them, and none but them. Ba. What
am I iudebted ιο them fort pray tell me. Th. It is their opinion of
you, or rather their error, that has raised you to the pitch of a goddess
aud not your noble birth. Ba. But (if time would permit) I could
authentioally derivo my pedigree from the divinity itself. Th. A rare
pedigree, I will warrant you! Pray let us have it, there is time .

My father was one who would not knock under to him, either for

fame, and glory‚ and adorere: what signifies the body'l Th. No great
matter, indeed, saving that a deformed mind usually accompanies a

deformed body. But come on, we will come ιο those things. Ba.
