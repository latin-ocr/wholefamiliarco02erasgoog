not have a belly-gut for thy servant, but rather one brisk and agile,
why, then, dost thou provide for thy mind a minister fat and unwieldyl
Ph. I yield to truth.

Ne. Now, see another missortune. As tbe mind far excels the
body, so you will confess that the ricbes of the mind sar exceed the
goods of the body. Ph. What you say 10 very probable. Ne. But
amongst all the goods of the mind wisdom holds the chief place. Pla.
I confess it. Ne. For obtaining this no time is more fit than the
morning, when the new-rising sun gives fresh vigour and life to all
things, and dispels those fumes which are exhaled from the stomach,
which are wont to cloud the mansion of the mind. Pla 1 (10 001 deny
it. Ne. Now, do but consider what a share of learning you might
obtain in those four hours which you consume in unseasonable sleep.
Ph. Truly, a great share. Ne. I have experienced that more may be
done at study in one 11011110 the morning than 10111100 after noon, and
that without any detriment to the body. Ph. I have heard as much.
Ne. Consider this further: if you should bring into a gross 01101 the
1000 01 each particular day, what a vast deal would it amount to ! Pb.
A great deal, indeed. Ne. He who haedlessly confounds money and
'ewels is deemed a prodigal, and has a guardian appointed 11110, Now,
he who destroys these so much more precluus goede, is not he a prodi·
gal 01 a 101 (100001 dyel Pu Certainly it is so, if we rightly weigh
the matter.

Ne. consider further what Plato writes, That there is nothing
fairer, nothing more amiable than wisdom, which, if it could be seen
by corporeal eyes, would reise to itself an incredible number of ad-
mirere. Ph. But she is not capable of being seen. Ne. Iowu sbe
is not with corporeal eyes ; but she 10 to be seen with the eyes 01 the
mind, which is the better part of man. And where the love is in-
credible, there must necessarily be the highest pleasure, as osten as the
mind enjoys so pleasing a mistress. Ph. What you say is very
probable. Ne. Go now, if you think good, and barter this enjoyment
for sleep, that image of death. Ph. But in the meantime Ι lose my
dear nocturnal 000110. Ne. These things are well lost, which being
worst are changed for the hest, shameful for honourable, most vile for
the most precious. He has happily lost his lead who has changed it
into gold. Nature has appointed the night for sleep, the eun arising

They who sleep (saith st. Paul, 1 Thess. 5) sleep in the night, and they
who are drunken are drunlren iu the night Therefore, what can be
more unseemly than, when all animale rouse with the sun, nay, some
