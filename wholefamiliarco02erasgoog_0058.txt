THE YOUTH’S PIETY. tl

*my companions arith ¹some lawful recreation till the time comcs to go
to school again. Ifr. Do you salute Jesus againl θα ch, if Ι
have an opportunity; but if it so happen thatI have not an oppor-
tunity, or it be not seasonable, as 1 pass by the churchI salute Him
mentally3 and then Ι do what is to bc done at school with all my
might3 and when Ι go home again I do what 1 did before dinncr.
After supper I divort myself with some pleasant stories 3 and after·
wards bidding my parents and the family good night, l go t'o bed
betimes‚ and there, kneeling down by the bedside, as I have said, I say
over those things Ι have been learning that day at school; if lhave
committed any great fault, I implore Christ’s clemency, that H e would
pardon mc, and Ι promise amendment: and if Ihave committed no
fault, I thank Him for His goodness in preserving mc from all vice,
and then Ι commend myself to Him with all my soul, that He would
preserve me from the attempta of my evil genius and filthy dreams.

When this is done, and lam got into bed, Ι crosa my forehead and ·

breast, and composa myself to rest Er. In what pastura do ¹you
composa yoursclfl θα. Idon't lio upon my face or my back, but
first leaning upon my right side, I fold my arms across, so that they
may defend my breast, as it were with the figure of a crosa, with my
ltttlttlt‘letltlfl'flthttt ftlffttt lllffllludal?
You are a little saint that can do thus. θα. Yon are a little fool for
saying so. Er. Ipraisc your method, and 1 would Icould practiso
it Ga. (live your mind to it and you will do it, for when once you
have accustomed yourself to it for a few months, these things will be
pleasant and become natural. ·

Er. But I want to hear concerning divine service, θα. Ι don't
neglect that, especially upon holy days. Er. How do you marriage
yoursclf on holy daysl θα. In the first place,I examine myself if
my mind be polluted by any stain of sin. Er. And if you find it is,
what do you thenl Do you refrain from the altarl θα. Not by my
bodily presence, but I withdraw myself, as to my mind, and standing
as it were afar off, as though not during to lift up my eyes to God the
Father, whom Ι have offendcd‚I atrike upon my brcaat, crying out
with the publican in the gospel, “ Lord‚ be merciful to me a sinner.”
And then, if IknowI have offended any man,I take care to make
him satisfaction, ifI can, presently; but ifI cannot do that, Ι resolve
ln my'mind to reconcile my neighbour as soon as possible. If anybody
has offcnded me,I forbear revenge, and endeavour to bring it about
that he that has offendcd me may bc made sensible of his fault and be
sorry for it; but if there be no hope of that, I leave all vcngcance to
God. Er. That is a hard task. θα. Is it hard to forgive a small
offencc to your brother, whose mutual forgiveness thou wilt stand in
frequent need of, when Christ has at once forgiven us all our offences,
and is every day forgiving usl N ay, this seems to me not be liberality
to our neighbour, but putting interest to θοᾶς just as though one
follow-servant should agree with another to forgive him three groats
that his lord might forgive him ten taleuts.

Er. Yon, indeed, argue very rationally‚ if what you say be true,
Ga. Can you desire anything truer than tbe Gospell Er. That is
