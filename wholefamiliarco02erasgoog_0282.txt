transgresses a divine law, ἒ watra. Ba. Where is the difference in
mingling vinegar and wormwood, which is put in first, if I must drink
them bothl Or what matter is it whether a stone that has given me
a wound rebounds from me ιο a friend directly or sidcwaysl Fi I
have learned that. Bu. And if the modus of a law's binding, in laws
of both kinds, is to be taken from the matter and circumstances, what
difference is there between the authority of God and that of mant
Fi. Indeed, a very wicked question. Bu. There are, for all-that,
a great many that do not think there is much difference. God gave a
law by Moses, and it is not lawful ιο violate it ; and He also gives laws
by a pope or a council-what difference is there between the one and the
otherl Moscs’s law was given by God, and our laws were given by
rnen, and it should seem that those laws whichGod gave by one Moses
should be ot' less moment than those which the Holy Spirit gives by a
full council os bishops and learned men Fi. It is unlawful to doubt
concerning the spirit of Moses.

Bu. Paul comes in the place oi a bishop, what difference is there,
then, betwixt the precepts oi Paul and of any other bishopl Fi. Because,
without controversy, Paul wrote by the inspiration of the Spirit. Bu.
How far extends this authority os writersl Fi. I think no fartber
than the apostles themselves, unless that the authority of councils
ought to be looked upon inviolablo. Bu. Why may we not doubt of
Paul's spiriti Fi. Because the consent oi the church is against it.
Bu. May we doubt concerning that of bishopst Fi. We ought not
rashly to be suspicious oi those, unless the matter menifestly savours
of gain orimpiety. Bu. But what think you of the councils? Fi.
We ought not ιο doubt oi them, if they are rightly constituted and
managed by the Holy Spirit. Bu. Is there, then, any council that is
not sol Fi. It is possible there may be such, otherwise divines
would never have made this exception. Bra Then it seems that it is
lawful to doubt concerning councils themselves. Fi. I do not think
we may, if they be received and approved by tho judgment and con-
sent of Christian nationa

Bu. But since we have exceeded the bound that God has set, and
within which He would have the sacred and inviolablo authority oi the
scripture circumscribed, it seems to mo that there is some other
‹lifferenoo between laws divine and human. Fi. What is thatl Bu.
Divino laws are immutable, unless such as are of that kind that they
seem ιο be given only for a time, for the sake oi signification and
coercion, which the propheta ioretold should end as ιο the carnal sense
of them, and the apostles have taught us are to be omitted. And
then, again, as ιο human lawa: there are sometimes unjust, foolish, and
hurtful laws made, and therefore either abrogated by the authority of
superiora or by the universal neglectos the people; but there is
nothing such in the divine lawa

Again, a human law cesses oi itself when the causes for which it
was made cease ; as, ior instance, suppose a constitution should enjoin
all persons yearly to contribute something towards building a churcb,
the requirement oi the law ceases when the church is built Add to
this, that a human law is no law, unless it be approved by the consent
of those who are to use it. A divine law cannot be dispensed with nor
abrogated, although, indeed, Moses being about to make a law required
