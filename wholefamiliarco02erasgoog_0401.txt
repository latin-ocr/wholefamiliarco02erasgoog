the fire than into the shadow of the trec, for there are examples
innumerable of this kind. Moths included in parchment are trans
formed into butterflies by some secret workmanship of nature, though
they seem as if they were dead, and stir not if you touch them, unless
a spider ereep near them 3 then only they appear to be alive. They
cannot feel the touch of a man's finger, but they feel the feet oi
a very small animal crawling. Jo. An insect, before it is alive, can
be sensibie of his capital enemy. That which is related ooncerning
persons murdered is very like this—to whom if other persons approach,
there is no alteration3 but if he that killed thern comes nigh, presently'
blood flows fresh out of the wound3 and they say that by this token
the author of a murder has been often discovered.

Ep. What you have heard as to that matter isne fiction. But,
not to mention democritical storias, do we not find by experience that
there is a mighty disagreement between an oak and an olive tree, that
they will hoth die if they be planted into the ground of each other-l
And that an oak is so opposite to a walnut tree that it will die though
it be set at a good distance from it ; and, indeed, a walnut tree is
hurtful to most sorts of planta and trees. Again, though a vine will
twine its sprigs round all other things else, yet it shuns a colewort;
and, as though it were sensible of it, turns itself another way, as if
some person gave the vine notice that his enemy was near at hand.
The juice of cdeworts is a thing contrary tu wine, and they are
used to be eaten against drunkenness. But the colewort has its enemy
too; for if it he set near the herb called sow·bread, or wild marjoram,
it will wither presently. There is the like disposition between hemlock
and wine, as hemlock is poison to arnan, so is wine to hemlock. What
secret commerce· ia there between the lily and the garlio, that growing
near to one another they seem aa it were mutually to congratulata
one anotherl The garlic is the stmnger, but the lily flower smells the
aweeter. Why should I speak of the marriage of trees one with
another, the females being barren unless the male grows near them f

Oil will only mix with chalk, and both of them have an antipathy
to water„ Pitch attracta eil, though they araboth fat things. All
things but gold swim in quioksilver, and that only drawa it to itself
and embraces it. What sense of nature is that which seems to be in a
’ diamond that will resist everything that is hard, but grow soft in a
goat’s blood l · Nay, you may see an antipathy even in poisons them-
selves A scorpion, if it chance to creep through benbane, grows pale
and benumbed. And the herb, cerastis is so noxious to a scorpion, that
he that handles the seed of it may take a scorpion into his hand.
There are abundance of things of this kind, but the consideration of
them more properly belongs to physicians.

What a mighty power of either sympathy or antipathy is there ,
between the steel and the loadstone, that a matter heavy by nature
should run to and cleave to a stone, as though it kissed it, and with-
out touohing it should fly backwardl And as to water, which readily
mingles with all things, but most of all with itself, yet there are some
waters which, as though they hated one another, will not mix ς as for
instance, the river flowing into the Lake Fucinus runs over it, aa Addua
does to Larius, as Ticinus to Verbanus, Mincius to Benacus, Ollius tc
sevinus, Rhodanus to Lemenus: some of which for many miles only
