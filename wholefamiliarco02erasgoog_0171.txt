qaod quemnemo norit The ambiguity lies in τὸυτο. Is it should be
taken in the accusative case, the sense will be this, thtsoever itis
thet anybody knows, that thing he knows to be. But if in the
nominative case, the sense will be this, That thing which anybody
knows, it knows ; es though that could not he known that knows not

again by course. Again, he adds another example, Ἀρο ὅ τις ὁρᾷ,
τόυτο ὁρᾷ, ὁρᾷ δὲ τὸν κίονο, ibes ὁρᾷ ὁ κίων, that which any one
sees, does that thing see 3 but he sees a post, does the post therefore

scel The ambiguity lies again in τόυτο, as we shewed before.
But these sentences may be rendered into Latin well enough ς but

that which follows cannot possibly by any means he rendered‚'Ape ὅ σὺ
φὴς είνοι, rouro σὺ φὴς elect: φὴς δὲ λίθον ιίνοι, σὺ cipe φὴς λίθος
elrat- Which they thus render, putas qaod tc diois cese; hoe ta dicis esse,
dicis autem lapidem esse, ιιι eryo lapis dicis esee. Pray, tell me what sense

can be made of these words l · For the ambiguity lies partly in the idionr
of the Greek phrase, which is in the major and minor. Although in the

major there is another ambiguity in the two words θ and τόυτο, which
if they be taken in the nominative case the sense will be, That which
thou seyest thou art, that thou arth hut if in the accusative case the
sense will be, Whatsocver thou sayest is, that thou sayest is; and to

this sense he subjoins λίθον φὴς ιίνοι,,ίιοο to the former sense he

subjoins eb ἆρα φὴς λίθος εἶναι.Ι Catullus once attempted to imitate
the propriety of the Greek tongue:

Phaselus istc, quem videtis, hospites,
Ait fuisse naviom celerrimus.

“My guests, that galley which you see,
The most swift of the navy is, says he.¹’

For so was this verse in the old edition. Those who write commen·
taries on these places being ignorant of this, must os necessity err
many ways. N either, indeed, can that which immediately follows be
perspicuous in the Latin. Kal ἆρα ἐστι σιγῶντα λέγειν; disper γὰρ
ἐστι, τὸ σιγῶντα λέγειν ; τὸ τε τὸν λέγοντο σιγᾷν, κὰι τὸ τὰ λέγομενο.
That they have rendered thus: Et putas, est ιιιιοιιιοιο dicere? Duplex
enim eet, ιοοιιιιιιιι dicere· et Ιιιιιισ dicem ιοοοιιιοιιι, et quse dicantur. Are
not these words more obscure than the books of the Sibylsl Hi.
Iam not satisfied with the Greek.

to speak while he is silenti This interrogation has a twofold sense,
the one of which is false end absurd, end the other may he true3 for
it cannot possibly be that he who speaks should not speak what he
does speak ; that is, that he should be silent while he is speaking; but
it is possible that he who speaks mey be silentes him who speaks
Although this example falls into another form that he adds e little
