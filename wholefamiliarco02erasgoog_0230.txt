THE FABULOUS BANQUET. 223

Phi. Perhaps that I am going to tell you will not seem so enter-
taining. Howaver, l entreat you that you would not bo suspicious that
I use any deceit or collusion, or think that I have a design to desire to
be exeuscd. One came to the sama Louis with a petition that hc would
bestow upon him an office that happened to be vacant in the town
where 116 lived. The king, hearing the petition read, answers imme-
diately, You shall not have it, hy that means putting him out 61 any
future cxpectation ; the petitioner immediately returns the king thanks

and goes his way. The king observing the man’s countenance, per· ⁸

ceived he was no blookhead, and thinking perhaps he might have
misunderstood what he said, bid him be called back again. He came
back: then says tha king, Did you understand what I said to youl I
did understand you, quoth he. Why, what did Isayl That I should
not have' it, said he. What did you thank 1116 161 thenl Why, says
ha, I have some business to do at home, and therefore it would have
beenatroublc to meto have here danced attendance afteradoubtful hope ;
now I look upon it a benefit that you have denied me the office quickly,
aud so Ι count myself to have gained whatsoeverl should have lost by
attendance upon it, and gone without it at last. By this answer, the
king seeing the man to be no blookhoad, having asked bima few
questions, says he, You shall have what you asked 161, that you may ,
thank me twice, aud turning to his officers, Lot, says he, letters patent
be made out for this man without delay‚ that he may not be detained
here to his detriment.

Eup. I could tell you a story 61 Louis, but I had rather tell one
of our Maximilian, who, as he was far fronr hiding his money in the
ground, so he was very generous to those that had spent their estates,
11 they were nobly descended He being mindcd to assist a young
gentleman that had fallen under these circumstances, sent him on an
embassy to demand an hundred thousand florina 61 a certain city, hut
Iknow not upon what account. But this was the condition 61 11, that
11 he by his dexterity could make any more of it, it should be lris own.
The ambassador extorted fifty thousand from them, and gave Oaesar

thirty of them. Caesar being glad te receive more than ha expected, ’

dismisses the man without asking any questions. In the meantime
1116 treasurer and receivers smelt the matter, that he had received
more than hc had paid in; they importune Caesar tosend for him, he
being sent 161, comes immediately. Says Maximilian, l hear you have
received fifty thousand. He confessed 11. But you have paid in but
thirty thousand. He confessed that too. Says he, You must give an
account of it. He promised he would do 11, and went away. But

he thus eluding the matter, the officere insisted more pressingly upon
it, crying out it was a great affront to play upon Caesar at this rate.
They persuaded the king to send 161 him, and make him balance tha

account before them. Caesar agrees 1ο 11, he is sent for, comes imme·
diately, and does not refusa to do anything. Then says Caesar, Did
not you promise to balance the account? Yes, said he. Well, says he,
