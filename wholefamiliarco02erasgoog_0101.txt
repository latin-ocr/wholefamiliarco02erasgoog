94 FAMILIAR consuamus

Pi Your house is so full oi talk that not only thewalls but the
very cup speaks Eu. What does it ssyl Ti ⁴‘ No manishurt but
by himself.” Eu. The cup pleads for the cause of the wine. For it is
a common thing, if persons get a sever or the headache by over drink-
- ing, ιο lay it upon the wine, when they have brought it upon them-

selves by their excess. Sept. Mine speaks Greek. Ἐν <lamp ἁηθεία,

ἰιι wine there is truth (when wine is in the wit is out). Ec. This
gives us to understand that it isnot safe lor priests or privy counsellors
to give themselves so ιο wine, because wine commonly brings that ιο
the mouth that lay concealed in the heart. So. In old time among
the Egyptians it was unlawful ior their priests ιο drink any wine at
all, and yet in those days there was no auricular confession. sc. It
iis nepv become lawful ior all persons ιο drink wine, but how expedient
tis know not.

So. What book is that, Eulalius, you take out of your pocketl
It seems ιο ιο a very neat one, it is all over gilded. Eu. It is more
valuable sor the inside than the out It is St. Paul’s Epistles, that Ι
always carry about me as my beloved entertainment, which I take out
now upon the occasion of something you said, which minds me of a
place that Ι have beat my hrains about a long time, and I am not
come ιο a full satisfaction in yet. It is in the sixth chapter os the first
’ Epistle to the Corinthiam, “All things are lawful for mc, but all things
are not expedient, all things are lswful for me, but Ι will not be
brought under the power of any.” In the first place (if we will believe the
Stoica) nothing can bc profitablc to us that is not honest. How comes
Paul, then, to distinguish betwixt that which is lawfnl and that which
is expedienti It is not lawful to whore or get drunk 3 how then are all
things lawfull But if Paul speaks of some particular things only
which be would have to be lawful, [cannot guess by the tenor of the
place what those particular things are. Promthat which follows it
may be gathered that he there speaks ol the choice of meets Por
some abstain from things offered ιο idols, and others from meats
forbidden by Moses' law. In the eighth chapter he treats of things
offered to idols, and in the tenth chapter, explaining the meaning os
this place, says, “All things are lawful forme, but all things are not
expedient, all things are lawlul for me, but all things edify not. Lot
no man seek his own, but every man the things of another. Whatso-
ever is sold in the shambles, eat ye.'’ And that which St. Paul
subjoins agrees with what he said before: “ Mcats sor the belly, and
the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them.’' Now
that which has respect ιο the J udaical choico of meats is in the close

of the tenth chapter: “ Give none offense, neither ιο ιιο Jews nor ·

the Gentiles, nor ιο ιιο church of (lod, even as I plesse all men in all
things, not secking my own profit, but the proiit of many, that they
may be saved.¹’ Where in that he saith ιο the Gentiles, he seems ιο
have respect ιο things offered to idols; and where he speaketh to the
Jews he seems to refer to ohe choica of meats3 what he says ιο the
church of God appertains to the weak collected out ol both sorta.

It was lawful, it seems, ιο eat of all meets whatsoever, and all
things that are clean to the clean. But the question remaining is,
Whethcr it be expedient or nott The liberty of the Gospel makes all
things lawful 3 but charity has always a regard to my neighbour's good,
