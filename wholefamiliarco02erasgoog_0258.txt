THE ratleicus praemimur. 251

the morning he was as sober as ever. Me. Perhaps he was not dis-
tracted but drunlr, and sleep commonly cures that distemper. Oq.
Menedemus, since you love to use raillery, take another subject
It is neither pious nor saie to make sport with saints; nay, the man
himself told me that there was a woman appeared to him in his sleep
of an incomparable beauty, that held forth a cup to him to drink. Ma
Hellebore, Ι believe. Oq. That is uncertain3 but this is certain, that
the man recovered his reason.

Me. Did you pass by Thomas, Archbishop of Canterburyl 09·
No, Ι think I did not. It is one of the most religious pilgrimages in
the world Me. I long to hear it, if it will not be too much trouble to
you. 09. Itis so far from that, that you will oblige mein hearing of
it. That part of England that looks towards Flanders and France is
called Kent3 the metropolis of it is Canterbury. There are two
monasteries in it that are almost contiguous, and they are both of
Benedictines. That which bears the name of Augustino isthe ancienter
of the two, that which is now called by the name of St. Thomas
seems to have been the seat of St. Thomas the archbishop, where be
had led his life with a few monks whom he chose for his companions‚
as now-adays deans have their palaces near the church, though separate
from the houses of other canons. For, in old time, both bishops and
canons were mealia, as appears by the manifest vestigia of things.

But the church thetis dedicated to St. Thomas raises itself up to·
wards heaven with that majesty that it strikes those that behold it at
a great distance with an awe of religion, and now with its splendour
makes the light of the neighbouring palaces look dim, and as it were
obscures the place that was anciently the most celebrated for religion.
There are two lofty turrets which stand as it were bidding visitante
weloome from afar off, and a ring of belis that make the adjacent
country echo far and wide with their rolliug sound. In the south
porch of the church stand three stone statues of men in armonr, who
with wicked hands murdercd the holy man, with the names of their
countries—Tusci, Fusci, and Betri. Mc. Why have such wicked men “
so much honour done theml 09. They have the same honour done
to them that is done to dudae, Pilate, Oaiaphas, and the band of wicked
soldiers whose images you may see carvcd upon stately altars; and
their names are added that none after them might arrogata to them· '
selves the glory of the fact They are set there in open sight to be a
warning to wicked courtiers, that no one may hereafter presumo to lay
his hand on either bishops or the possessione of the church. For these
three ruffians ran mad with horror of the fact they had committed ; nor
had they come to themselves again, had not holy Thomas been implored
in favour of them. Ma Oh, the perpetual clemency of martyrsl

09. When you are entered in, a certain spacious majesty of place
opens itself to you, which is free to every one. Me. Is there nothing
to bo seen therel Oq. Nothing but the bulk of the structure, and
some books chained to the pillars, containing the gospel of Nicodamus
and the sepulchre of I cannot tell who. Me. And what elsel 09.

. Iron grates enclose the place called the choir, so that there is no en·

trance, bur so that the view is still open frum one end of the church to
the other. You ascend to this by a great many steps, under which
there is a certain vault that opens a passage to the north side Thera
