THE YOUTH’S PIETY. 53

arn not quite seventeen years oid3 but yet, if Ι lind occasion, Ι dine
plnd sup sparineg, that I may be more lively for spiritual exereises on
ol da s.

yh'r.y Since I have began,I will go through with my inquiries.
How do you find yourself affected towards sermons? Ga. Very weil.
Igo to them as devoutly as if Ι was going to a hely assemhiy3 and
yet Ι pick and choose whom te hear, forthere are some one had better ,
not hear than hear; and if such an one happens to preaeh, or if it
happen that nobodypreaehes,1 pass this time in reading the scrip·
tures. I read the gospei or epistie, with Chrysostom's or Jerome's
interpretation, or any other learned interpreter that I meet with.
Er. But word of mouth is more affecting. Ga. Ι consessit is. I had
rather hear, if Ι ean but meet with a tolerable preac'her; bnt Ι don’t
seem to he wholly destitute of a sermon if I hear Chrysostom or
J creme speaking hy their writings

Er. Ι am of your mind 3 but how do yon stand affected as to
confessioni Ge. Very well, for I confess daiiy. Er. Every dayi
Ga. Yes. Er. Then yon ought to keep a priest to yonrself. Gn.
But Ι confess to iiim who only trnly remita sins, to whom nil tire
power is given. Er. Towhomi Ge. ToChrist. Er. And do yon
think that is sufficienti Ge. It would be enough for me, if it were
enough for the rulers of the chureii, and received eustom. Er. Who
do you call the rulers of the churehi Ge: The 1›opeS,bishops,and
aposties. Er. And do you put Christ into this numberi Ge. He
is, without controversy, the chief head of them aii. Er. And was He
the author of this confession in usei Ge. He is, indeed, the author
of aii good 3 but whether He appointed confessiones it is now used
in the church, I leave to be disputed hy divincs. The authority of my
betters is enough for me that am hut a lad and a private person. This
is certainly the principal confessi0n; nor isit an easy matter to confess
to Ohrist3 nobody confesses to Him but he that is angry with his sin.
If I have committed any great offense, I iay it open, and bewaii it to
Him, and implore His merey; Ι cry out, weep and iament, nor de Ι
give over before Ι feei the iove cf sin thoronghiy purged from the
bottom of my beart, and some tranquillity and cheerfuiness of mind
follow upon it, which is an argument of thesin being pardoned. And
, when the time requires to go to the hely communion of the body and
blood of Christ, then I make confession te a priest too, hut in few
words, and nothing but what Ι am weil satisfied are fauits, or such
that carry in them a very great suspicion that they are sueh; neither
do I always take it to be a capital or enormens crime everything that '
's done contrary to human constitutions, unless a wieked contemp
tueusness shall go along with it; nay, I scaree believe any crime to be
capital that has not maiiee joined with it-that is, a perverse will.

Er. I commend you, that you are so religione, and yet not super·
stitione. Here, 1 think, the old proverb takes piace, Nec omnia, owe
’ passim nce quibuslibet, that a person should neither speak all, nor
everywhere, nor to all persons. Ge. I choose me a priest that Ι ean
trust with the secreta of my heart. Er. That is wisely done, for
there are a great many, as is found by experienee, do biab out what in

confessione is discovered to them3 and there are some vile impudent

fellows that inquire of the person confessing those things that it were
