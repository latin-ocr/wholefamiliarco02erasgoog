90 FAMILIAR condemna ’

hut kings, who are above sear, the more they are opposed the bercer
their displeasur03 and therefore kings, as often as they are resolutely
bent upon any, should be left to themselves ; not in respectos any
confidence of the goodness of their inclinatione, but because God many
times makes use ol their follies and wickedness aa the instrumente for
the punishment of the wicked.” As He forbade that Nebuchadnezzar
should be resisted, because He had determined to chastise His peoplc
by him as an instrument And peradventure, that which Joh says
looks this way: “ Who maketh the hypocrite reign lor the sins of
His people.” And perhaps that which David says, bewailing his sin,
has the same tendency: “ Against thee only have 1 sinned, and done
this evil in thy sight.'' Notas if the iniquity of kings were not fatal
to the people, but because there is noue that has authority to condemn
them but God, from whose judgment there is indeed no appeal, be the
person never so great. ri. I like the interpretation well enough thus
far3 but what is meant by the rivers of watersl

Eu. There is a similitude made use of that explains it. The
wrath os a king is impetuous and unruly, and not to be led this way
or that way, but presses forward with a restless fury; as 'the sea
spreads itsels over the land, and flows sometimes this way and some
times that way, not sparing pastores nor palaeae, and sometimes buries
in its own bowels all that stands in its way3 and if you should
attempt to stop its course, or to turn it another way, you may even as
well let it alone. Whereas, let it but alone, and it will sink of itself,
as it happens in many great rivers, as is storied of Achelous. There
is less injury done by quietly yielding than by violently resisting.
Ti. Is there no remedy, then, against the unruliness of wicked kingsl
Ila. The first will be, not to receive alion into the city ; the second
is to tie him up by parliamentary and municipal lawa, that he cannot
easily break out into tyranny. But the best os all would be to train
him up from his childhood in the principles ol piety and virtue, and to
sorm his will before he understands his power. Good counsels and
persuasione go a great way, provided they be seasonable and gentle.
But the last resort must beto beg of God to incline the king’s heart
to those things that are becoming a Christian king. ri. Do you
excuse yoursell because you are a laymanl If I were a bachelor in
divinity‚ I should value myself upon this interpretation. Eu. I
cannot tell whether it is right or wrong, itis enough sor me is it were
not impious or heretical. However,1have done what you required
of me, and now, according to the reales of conversation, it is my turn
to hear your opinion.

Ti. The compliment you passed upon my grey hairs gives me
some kind os title to speak next to the text, which will bear yet a
more mysterious meaning. Aa. I believe it may, and I should be
glad to hear it. Ti. “By the word king may be meant a man so
persected as to have wholly subdued his lusts, and to be led by the

impulse of the Divina Spirit only.' Now, perhaps, it may nothe
proper to tie up such a person to the conditione of human lawe, but
to leave him to his Master, by whom he is governed. Nor is he to
be judged according to the mensures by which the frailty of imperfect
men advanoes towards true holiness; but is he steers another course,
we ought to say with St. Paul, ‘God heth accepted him, and to his
