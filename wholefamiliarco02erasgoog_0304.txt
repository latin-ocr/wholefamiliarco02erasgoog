ffls' FUNERAL. 297

those poor people. The fullers and tanners march in the van, the
cobblers bring up the rear, and the monks marchia the body ; you
would have said it had been s chimera, ifyou had seen it. And Georgo
had this cantion too, that the Fhanciscans and Dominicans should
draw lota which should go first at the funeral, and after them the rest,
that there might be no quarrelling for place. The parson and clerk
went in the lowest place (that is, first), for the monks would not endure
it otherwise. lla. Ilind Georgo had shill in marshalling of a cere-
mony as well ss an army. Ph. And it was provided that the funeral
service, which was to be performed by the parish priest, should be per·
formed with a concert of music, for the greater honour of the deceased.

While these and such like things were doing, the patient was
eeized with a convulsion, which was a certain token that hewse near
his end, so that they were now come to the last act. Ma. Why, ia
not all done yetl Pla Now, the pope’s bull is to be read, wherein
he is promised a full pardon of all his sins, and an exemption from the
sear of purgatory‚ and with a justification over and above of his whole
estate. Ma. What, of au estate got by rapiuel 4³1». Got by
the law of arms and fortune of war. But one Philip, a ci-vilian, his
wife’s brother, happened to, be by at the reading of tho bull, and took
notice cf one passage that was notas it should be, and raised a scruple
upon it of its not being authentic. Ma. lt might very well have
been let pass at this time, and no notice taken of it, if there had been
any error, and the sick never the worse for it. Ph. Iam of your
mind, and lwill assure you it so wrought upon Georgo, that it had
like to have cast him into despair 3 and iu this case Vincent shewed
himself a man indeed, he bid George be satisfied, for that he had an
authority to correct or supply any error or omission that might be iu
the bull. So that, says he, if this bull should deceive you, this soul of
mine shall stand engaged for thine‚ that tbine shall go to heaven, or
mine be damned. '

Ma. But will eod accept of this way of changing soulsl· or, if he ,
does, is the pawn of Vincent's seul a sufficiant security for· George'sf
What if Vincent's soul should go to tbe devil, whether he changes it or
no! Pa. Ι only tell you matter of fact lt is certain that Vincent
affected this by it, that the sich mun was much comforted. By and by
the covenants are read, by which the whole society promise totransfer
to George the benefits. of¹ the works which were done by all the four
orders, and aleo a fifth, that of the carthusiano. Ma. Ishould be
afraid that such a weight would sinlr mc to hell, if Ι were to carry it.
Ph. Ι spculr of their good works only 5 for. they bear down a soul that
is about to fly to heaven no more than feathers do a bird. Ma. But
who will they bequeath their evil works to theut Pla To, the German
soldiers of fortune. Mo. By what rightl Ph. By gospel right ; for,
‘⁴ to him thathee shall be given.'' And then was read over how many
messes and psalma were to accompany the soul of the deceased, and
there was a vast number of thern. After this, his confession was

repeated, and they gave him their benediction.

Mc. And so he diedl Pla. Not yet. They laid a mat upon the
ground, rolled up at one end in the form of s pillow. Ma Well, and
what is to be done nowl Ph. They strewed ashes upon it, but very
thiu, and there they laid the sicle man's body 3 and then they conse-
