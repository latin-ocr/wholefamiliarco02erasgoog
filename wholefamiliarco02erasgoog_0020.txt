and on Palm-Suaday devontly perform a ridiculous action, and drag
en ass by a rope, making themselves at most as mere asses astho
wooden ase they drag along. They also that have gone on pilgrimage
to Compostella have imitated them in this. Let these practices be
allowed, let them ιο allowed ιο gratify the hnrnours os men; but itis
an insufferable thing that they should make it a part of piety. These
persons also are remarked upon who shew uncertain relics for certain
ones, ancy¹ attribute more ιο them than ought ιο ιο, and basely make a
in of t ern.

ga In the Ichthyophagia, orFish-eating,1treatof human constitutions
which some wholly reject, deviating much from right reason: and on
the otherhand, semein a manner prefer them before divine lawe : and
some again ebuso institutione both human and divine ιο gain and
tyranuy. I therefore endeavour to temper both parties to moderatim,
, by inquiring from whence human constitutions have had their original,
aud by what steps they have edvanced till this time, on what persons,
and how far they are obligatory ; to what ends they are useful, how sar
they differ from divine ; shewing by the way the preposterous judg·
ments of men of which the world is now full, and from whence this up
roar in the world proceeded. And I have treated of these things more
at large for this reason, that I might give occasion to the learned ιο
write more accurately of them; for those that have written of them
hitherto have not given satisfaction to the curione. It was not so much
to the purpose to write against whoring, drunkenness, and adultery, be·
cause none are deceived by these things ; but true piety is endangered
by the other, which either are not perceired or do allure by a deceitful
show· of sanctity.

In the Funeral, inasmuch as death commonly tries the hope of a
Christian, I have represented a different kind of death in two private
persons, as it were by a lively image, representing the different departure
of those that put their trust in fictione and of those who have placed
the hope ol their salvation in the Lord's mercy ; by the way reproving
the foolish ambition of rich men, who extend their pride and luxury
even beyond their death, which death at least ought to take away 3 also
reprehending the error of those who ebuso the folly of those men to
their own profit, when it is their business in an especial manner ιο
correct it. For who is he that shall presumeto admonish with freedom
men of power and wealth, if monks, who profess themselves dead to the
world, soothe their vices l If there are not any such as 1 have described,
yet I have produced an example that ought to ιο avoided 3 but if more
accursed things than Ι have set forth are reported ιο ιο commonly
practised, then those that are just ought to acknowledge my civility,
and amend that in which they are to blame ; and if they are blameless
themselves, let them either reform or restrain those who do offend. Ι
have reviled no order, unless he shall ιο accounted to defame all
Christendom that by way of admonition shall say anything against the
corrupt manners of Christians. These that are so concerned for the
honour ol the order, ought to be hindered from finding fault with me,
especially by those who by their actions do openly disgrme the order.
And since they own, cherish, and defend such as are brother-companions,

‚ with what face can they pretend that the honour of the order ie lessened

hy one that faithfully admonishest although what ressonis there
