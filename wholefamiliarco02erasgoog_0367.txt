in the song 01 110 Virgin Mary, and 01 110 same time do in like
manner interpret what we read, Gen. xxix, “The Lord bath loolred upon

my affliction,'' ταπείνωσιν : Leeh does 001 boast of her modesty, but
in that, by reason of her deformity, 010 was lese pleasing 10 her
husband, she calls her afflicticn. After the same manner in Deuter-
oncmy xxvi, “And looked 00 001 0111101100, and our labour, and our

oppression.” Dces 10 001 call ταπείνωσιν afflictioni

most perfect and incomparable in the hcly Virgin (Ι mean Christ
excepted); but in this very thing she is the more commendable for
modesty, in that she does not preise herself, but acknowledging her
