130 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

of her husband, not ιο ιο cheerful when he is melancholy, nor be,
merry when he isin a passion And ii at any time he was in a passion,
I either endeavoured to scothe him with iair words or held my tongue
till his passion was over3 and having had time to cool, opportunity
offered either of olearing myself or of admouishing him. 1 took the
same method if at any time he came home fuddled, and at euch a time
never gave him anything but tender language, that by kind expressions
I might gethim ιο go to bed.

Xa. This is indeed a very unhappy portion for wives il they
must only humour their husbands when they are in a passion, and
doing everything that they have a mind ιο do.

Ea As though this duty were not reciprocal, and that our
husbands are not forced to bear with many oi our humours. However,
there ie a time when a wife may take the freedom in a matter of some
importance tc advisa her husband ; but as for small fenita, it is better

¹ ιο wink at them. Xe. But what time is thatl Idu. When his

mind is serene, when ha is neither in a passion nor in the hippo, nor
in liquor, then, being in private, you may kindly advisa him, bnt
rather entreat him, that he would act more prudently in this or that
matter relating either ιο his estate, reputaticn, or health. And this very
advice is to ba seasoned with witty jests and pleasantries. Sometimes,
by way os preface, Ι make a bargain with him beforehand that he shall
nothe angry with me if, being a foolish woman,I take upon me to
advise him in anything that might seem to concern his honour, heelth,
or preservation. When I have eaid what 1 had a mind to say, I break
off that discourse, and turn it into some other more entertaining subject.
For, my Xantippa, this is the fault of us women, that when once we
have begun we don’t know when ιο make an end. Xe. Why, so they
sa , indeed.

y liu. This chiefly I observed as a rule, never ιο ohide my husband
before company, nor ιο carry any complaints out of dcere. What
pasees between two people is more easily mede up than when once it has
taken air. Now if anything of that kind shall happen that cannot be
borne with, and that the husband cannot ιο cured hythe admonition
oi his wife, it is more prudentior the wife ιο carry her complaints ιο
her husband's parents and kindred than ιο her own, and so ιο selben
her complaint, that she may not seem to hate her husband, but her
husband's vices ; and not ιο bleb out all neither, that her husband
may tacitly own and love his wife sor her civility. Xe. A woman
must needs be a philosopher who can be able to do this. Eu. By this
deportment we invita our husbands ιο return the civility. X a. But
there are some brutes in the world whom you cannot amend hythe
utmost good carriage.

du. In truth, Ι don’t think it; but put the case there are. First,
consider this, ahasband must be borne with, let him be as bad as he will.
It is therefore better to bear with him as he is, or made a little better

ιγ eur courteous temper, than ιγ our outrageousness to make him
grew every day worse and worse. What if Ι should give instances of

usbands who, by the like civil treatment, have altered their spouses
much for the betterl How muoh more does it become us to use our
, husbands after this manner? Χο. You will give an instance, then, of
a man that is as unlike my husband as black is from white.
