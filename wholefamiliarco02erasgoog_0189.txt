las FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

Pu. Into Franco. There Ι found some clothed all in blaek, of the
order of St. Benediot, who intimate by the colour of their clothes that
they are mourners in this world 3 and among these there were some
that for their upper garment wore haircloth like a net. Gl. A
grievous mortification of the flesh. Pc. Here Ι stayed eleven months

Eu. What was the matter that you did not stay there for good
and alll Po. Because I found there were more ceremonias than
true piety. And besides, Ι heard that there were some who were much
holier, which Bernard had enjoined a more severe discipline, the black
habit being changed into a white one. With these I lived ten months.
Eu. What disgusted you herel Pa. Ι did not much dislike anything,
¹for I found them very good company; but the Greek proverb ran in
my mind, ss τὰς χελῶνας ἢ φαγεῖν ἢ μὴ φαγεῖν, one must either eat
snails or eat nothing at all. Therefore I came to a resolution either
not to be a monk or to be a monk to perfeetion. Ι had heard there
were some of the order of St. Bridget that were really heavenly men.
Ι betook myself to these. Era How many months did you stay
therei Pa. Two days, but not quite that. Οἱ. Did that kind of
life please you no better than sol Pa They take nobody in but
those that will profess themselves presently 5 but Ι was not yet come
to that piteh of madness so easily to put my neck into such a halter
that Ι could never get off again. And as often as Ι heard the nuns
singing, the thoughts of my mistress that Ι had lost tormented my
mind. Οἱ. Well, and what after thiel

Pa. My mind was inflamed with the love of holiness‚ nor yet had
I met with anything that could satisfy it. At last, as I was walking
up and down, Ι fell in among some crosa-bearem. This budge pleased
me at first sight, but the variety hindered me from choosing which to
take to. Some carried a white eroes, some a red orosa, some a green
cross, some a particoloured eross, some a single cross, some a double
one, some a quadruplo, and others some of one form and somo of
another ; and Ι, that Ι might leave nothing untried, carried some of
every sort. But I found in reality that there was a great difference
between carrying a cross on a gown or a eoat and carrying it in the
beart. Aa last, being tired with inquiry, it cante into my mind that
to arrivs at universal holiness all at once Ι would take a jouruey to
the Holy Land, and ao would return home with a backload of sancti-
mony. Po. And did you go thither? Pa. YeS.

Po. Where did you get money to bear your charges? ra. I
wonder it never came into your head to ask that before nov, and not
to have inquired after that a grem while ago. But you know theold
proverb, A man of art will live anywhere. 01. What art do you
carry with youl Pa. Palmistry. Gt. Where did you learn itl
Pa. What significa thatl Gl. Who was your master'l Po. My
belly, the great master of all arta. I foretold things past, present, and
to come. cl. And did you know anything of the matter? Pu.
Nothing at all, but I made bold guasses, and ran no risk neither,
having got my money first. Po. And was so ridiculous en art suffi-
cient to maintain youl Pc. It was, and two servants too. There is
everywhere such a number of foolish young fellows and wenohes
However, when I came to Jerusalem Ι put myself int-0 the train of a
rich nobleman, who, being seventy years of age, said he could neres,
