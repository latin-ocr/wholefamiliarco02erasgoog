charge 161 wine, but only for the provisions 61 the feast. If any *a
differenoe about this matter shall huppen, let Gelasinus be judge. 11
you agree to 111666 conditione, let 1116111 be ratified. Ha that will no
observa the orders let him be gone, but with liberty 16 come again to
a collation the next day. We give our votes for the passing the bill
our king has brought in. But who must tell 1116 first storyl Eup.
Who should but the master of 1116 166611

Aa But, Mr. King, may 1 have 1116 liberty to speak three wordsl
Eua What, do you take the feast 16 be an unlucky 61161 As. Tha
lawyers deny that 16 be law that is not just. Eat. 1 grant 11. Aa
Your law makes the best and worst storias equal. saa Where

‘ diversionis the thing aimed at, there 116 deserves 66 much commenda»
tion who tells the worst 66 he 11161 16116 tho best story, because it
affords as much merriment ς as amongst songsters none are admired
but they that sing very well, or they 11161 sing very 111. Do not more
laugh to hear the cuekoo than 16 hear the nightingalel In this cass
mediocrity is 1161 praiseworthy. Aa. But pray, why must they ba
punished that carry 611 the prizel Eas. Lest their 166 great felicity
should exposa them 16 61111, 11 they should carry away 1116 prize, and

'go shotfoee 166. 116, By Bacchus, Minos himself never made a
'uster law.

J Pa. Do you make no order 66 16 the method 61 drinkingl Eat.
Has-ing considered the matter, I will follow 1116 example 61 Agesilaus
king of tho Laoedemoniana Pa What did he dol Eut Upon a
certain time, he being by lot 61166611 master of 1116 feast, when the
marshal 61 the 11611 6611611 him how much wine he should set before
every 1116111 If, says 116, you have a great deal 61111116, 161 every man
have as much as he calls for, hut if you are scarae 61 wine, give every
man equally alike. , Pb. What did 1116 Laosdemonian mean by thatl
Eut He did this that it might neither be a drunken feast nor a
querulous one. Ple. Why 661 Eat. Because some love 16 drink
plentifally, und 661116 sparingly, and some drink no wine 61 611; 611611
an one Romulus is said 16 have been. For ifnohody has any wine but
what he asks for, 111 the first place nobody 16 compelled 16 drink, and
there is no want to them that love 16 drink more plentifully. And 66
11 comcs 16 pass that nobody is melancholy at the table. And again, if
61 6 less quantity of wine every one has an equal portion, they that
drink moderately have enough 3 nor can anybody complain in an
equality, and they that would have drank more largely are coutentedly
temperate. If you like it, this is 1116 example I would imitate, for 1
would have 11116 feast 16 116 6 1611111666, but 1161 6 drunken one.

Ple. Bnt what did Romulus drink 1116111 aar. Tho same that
dags drink. Ph. Was not that unbeseeming 6 kingr 1166116
111616 111611 11 16 unseemly for a king 16 draw the 661116 611 that dogs do,
unless there is this differenee, 111611-6111113 does not drink the very
same water that a dog drank, but a dog draws in 1116 very same air
that the king bresthod out; and on the contrary, 1116 king draws in the
very same air that the dog breathed 6111 11 would have 116611 much
moreto Alexandar's glory 11 116 had dranlr with 1116 dogs. For there
is nothing worse for a king, who 1166 the care of 66 many thousand
persons, than drunkeuness. But 1116 apothegm that Romulus very
wittily made use of shews plainly that hewse 116 winedrinker. For
