Po. thre have you been with your spatterlsshesl 110111
- Tupinga. Po. 1011010 no news therel Br. I cannot but admire
that the world should run 00 strangcly a gudding 01101 news. 1 heard
a camel preach 01 Lcuvain, that we should have nothing to do with
anything 1101 10 new. Po. indeed, it 10 a conceit fit 1010 camel:
1101111011, if he be a man, ought never to change his old 01000 01 110
shirt, end always to seed upon stole egga, and drink nothing but 0001·
wine. Br. But 101011 1110, you must know, the good man does
not love old things so well, but that 10 had rather have 110 ponidge
fresh 11011 01010.
Po. No more 011110 0011101, but prithee, 1011 1110 what news have youl
Br. Nay, 1 have news iu my budget 100, but news which he says is
naught. Po. But that which 10 new will be old intime. 1101111011
011 things be good, and 011 new things be bad, then it follows 01 0011·
sequence that that which is good at present 100 been bad heretosore,
ι and that which is now bad will in 111110 001110 10 10 good. Br.
According to 110 doctrine 01 110 camel, it must be so, and therefore
hence it follows, that he that was a young wickcd 1001 in time past,
because he was new, will come 10 be a good 0110, because he 10 grown old.
Po. But, prithee‚ let us have the news, be it what it will.
' Br. The famous triple-tongued phoenix 01 learning, John Reuclin,
’10 departed this 1110. Ρο, For 00110101 Br. Nay, it is 100 00110111.
Ρο. Why, pray, what harm is that, 101 0 man to leave an immortul
memory 01 0 good name and reputatipn behind him, and 10 pass out 01
1110 111ἱο010110 world into the society of the blessedt Br. How do
you know that 10 10 110 case-l Po. 11 10 plain, 101 10 cannot die
otherwise who has lived as he did. Br. You would say 00, indeed, 11 ·
you knew what Ι know. Po. What is that, 1 pray‘l Br. Nc, no,I
must not tell you. Po. Why sol Br. Because he that entrusted
me with the secret made me promise silence. Po. Do you cntrust
me with it upon the 001110 condition, and, upon my honest word,I will
keep counsel. Br. That honest word has 011011 deceived me; but,
however, 1 will venture, especially it bein 0 matter 01 1101 kind that
it 10 fit 011 honest 111011 should know it. here is at Tubingc 0 00110111
Franciscan, 0 man accounted 01 singular holiness in cverybody’s
opinion but his own. Po. That you mention is 110 greatest argu-
mentinthe world 0111110 piety. Br. 11 Ι should tell you his name
you would say 00 much, 101 you know the man. Po. What 11 1 shall
guess 01111111 Br. Do,if you will. Po. Hold your ear then. Br.
What needs that, when here is nobody within hearingl Po. But,
however, 101 fashion's sake—Br. It istha very same. Po. He is 0
111011 (lii undoubted credit. Ι1 10 says a thing, it is to me as 1111000110
ospe.
g Br. Mind me, then, and Iwill give you the naked 11111101 1110
story. My friend Reuclin was sick, indeed very dangerously 3 but yet
there were some hopes 01 110 recovery; he was a man worthy never to
grew old, bs sick, 01 die. 0001001111οῌ100110110111111110110100011,
