ι the very walls thereteachdivinity. Fi. You say very right ; butasfor
· me, Ibrought nothing out of it but my body full of gross humours,
and my clothes full of lice. But to go on as I began: At that time
one John Standonins was president, a man whose temper you would
not mislilre, and whose qualifications you would eovet; for as Ι
remember, iu his youth, when he was very poor himself, he was
very charitable, and thetis much to be commended, and if he had
still supplied the necessities of young persons as he found them
materiale for going on with their studies, he would not have had so
much money to have spent lavishly‚ but would have done praise-
. worthily. But what with lying hard, by bad and spe-re diet, late and
s hard studies, within one year's space, of many young men of a good
, genius, and very hopeful, some he killed, others he blinded, others he
¹: made run distraeted‚ and others he brought into the leprosy, some of
¹, whom l know very well ; and, in short, not one of them but what was
p in danger by him. Was not this oruelty against one's neighbourl
Neither did this content him, but adding a cloak and oowl, he took
· away the eating of flesh altogether, and transplanted such plants as
, those into far distant countries. So that if every one should give
themselves such a liberty as he did himself, their followers would over-
spread the whole face of the earth.

If monasteries had their rise from sueh beginnings as these, what
danger are not only popes, but kings themselves in! It is a pious
thing ιο glory in the conversion of a neighbour to piety; but to seek
for glory in a dress or diet is pharisaical. Το supply the want of a
neighbour is a part of piety; ιο take eare that the liberality of good
men be not converted to luxury is discipline 3 but to drive a brother
into distempers, madness, and death is cruelty‚ is murdering him.
The intention of murder may, indeed, be wanting, but murder it is.
Perhaps some will say, nobody forces them into this kind of lise; they
come into it voluntarily, they beg to be admitted, and they are at liberty

¹ to go away when they are weary of it 3 but this is aeruel ansver. Is
it ιο be thought that young men can tell better what is good for them
than men of learning, experienee, and agel A man might thus excuse
himself to a wolf that had drawn him into a trop, when he was almost
famished with hunger. But ean he that sets unwholesome and poison·
ous food before a man thetis ready to gnaw his flesh for hunger so
excuse himself to him when he is perishing, by saying, N obody forced
you to eat it, you devoured what was set before you willingly and
eagerlyl May he not justly answer him, You have not given me food,
but poisonl Necessity is very prevalent, hunger is very sharp 3 there-
fore let them forbear to use these plausible excuses. They were,
indeed, at liberty to let it alone, but whosoever uses such engines
uses force.

Neither did this cruelty only destroy mean persons, but many

of itself, if it were not made the worse by the coldness of the morning.
