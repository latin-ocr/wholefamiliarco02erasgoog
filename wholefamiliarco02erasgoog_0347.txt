Well, let it be so ; but we had best have the deors shut, lest our queen

THE ASSEMBLyV gflleIXsdRLJAMEN T OF

Cornelio, Margaret, Parosta, J ulia, aad 0011101100.

Co. Since so many of you are assembled here todey, and in so
good humour, for the good and happiness 01 this eorrveution, and the
whole commonwealth of women, it gives me the greatest hope that
every one’s good genius will suggest to her those things that concern
the dignity and advantage 01 1110 whole sex. I believe you all know
what a prejudice it has been to our 0110110, that while the men have
had their daily meetings 101· trausacting their 0110110, we have been
sitting at our spinning-wheels aud neglected the management 01 our
own cause. Whence things are uow 001110 10 that pass that there are
not the least footsteps of discipline and government left amongst us,
and tharnen makes mere jest of 110, aud searce allow us tha title
01 rational creaturos. So that 11 we go 011 00 we have done, you may

rueetings. And we women, of all living creatur-cs, are the only ones
that have had no meeting of members at all. Ma. Oftener than is
becoming. 00. Do not interr-apt there, let me conclude my speech,
and you shall have all timo to speak in your turns. That which we
now do is 110 new thing; we only revive 011 old custom. For, 11 Ι am

Heliogabalus- Pe. Most praiseworthyi when itis certain he was
dragged about with a hook, and thrown into a house of office. Co.
Here Iam interrupted again. If we approve or disapprove 01 any
poison by this way 01 arguing, we 1111101 allow Christ was an ill person
because 110 was crucitied3 aad Domitian a good man because he died
in his bed. The worst thing that was laid to the charge of Heliogaba-
· lus was his flinging down to the ground tha sacred lire that was kept
by the 100101 virgins, and that he had the pictures 01 Moses and Christ
hanging up in his private ,chapeh whom, by way 01 contempt, they
