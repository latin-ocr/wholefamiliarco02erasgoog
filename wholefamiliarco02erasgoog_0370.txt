THE essholt 363

thought he deserved it, and would have done it had it not been for
respect to the place be. The reverence of a place ought not to pro-
tect such as profane it by their impiety. As he that within the vergo
of the court murders a man, it is not meet the church should be a
sanctuary to him ; so in like manner, he that in sacred discourses abusos
not only people’s patience but, also the sanctity of the place, ought not
to be screened by the place that be has by his temerity profaned. He
was commended by the ancients that would not permit any person to

be a clergyman that knows not how to preach a sermon.

Hi. Folks are afraid of the bishops’ thunderbolts, si quia instiyuata

level their thunderbolts at such railers. Hi. They themselves are
afraid of these follows. Le. Who are they afraid off Hi. Why, of
these bawling follows Le. Why sol Hi. Because they are bawling
fellows. Le. The apostles were not afraid of the menaees of kings and
rulers, and are they afraid ofa single beggarl Hi. For that very
reason they are the more to be feared, because they are beggam ; they

wasp's or hornet’s nest, and do but touch one of thern with your finger,
and if you come off well corne to me again, and then call the bishops
drones that are afraid of irritating one of these beggars. Do not the
most powerful monarcha of the Christian world revere the pope, nay,
and perhaps are afraid of him toci Le. That is no wonder, inasmuch
as he is the vicar of Christ. Hi. Well; but it is reported of pope Alex·

· he had rather offend one of the greatest monarcha than the least
brother of the order of Mendicants. a

that were at Augsburg heard it, did they not punish him for itl Hi.
They were all highly provoked at him, but especially King Fordinand
and his sister Mary, the ornament of her sex in this age, and Bernard,
Cardinal of Trent, and Balthasar,Bishop of Constance 3 and this¹ preacher

Bishop of Vienna, Le. What signifies chidingl an ass minda nothing
but a cudgel. Hi. Especially if you give him belly-timber. But
what should princes trouble their heads about such a silly follow as he
fort they had things¹ of far greater consequence to mind. Le. They
should at least have silenced him from preaching, and taken away his
pension. Hi. But the cunning rogue put off the spitting his venom
till just at the breaking up of the diet, and they were just going away.
Le. They say the davil goes away sc, leaving a stink behind him.

his comrades for having acted his⁴ part so bravely and successfully;
