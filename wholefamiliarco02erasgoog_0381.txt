what oould you expect when the master 01 the house is 00101 orderf
Ja. Βο1 was 110 siok in good 00100011 01. So sick that he would
have devoured your three capons to his own share, if you would have
treated him. .Ιο Ι am impatient 10 hear your bill 011010. Gi. First
01011 there is a plateful of grey peas brought iu, such asold women
ory about 1110 streete, and this was for our landlord's own eating; 110
pretended that this was his remedy against all diseases. Jo, How
many guosts were there of you at table? Gi. Sometimes eight 01 0100 ;
among whom was one Verpius, a learned gentleman, to whose character
Isuppuso you are no 011003000οἀ our landlord's oldest son. Ja.
What was their messl Gi. Why, the same that Melchisedek offered
1ο Abraham, 01101 he had conquered the five kings 5 and was not that
enough 101 any reasonable 10001

110. Βο1 was there no 010011 Gi. There was meat, but thera was
buta 1011 little 01 it. J a. What was 111 si. I remember we wera
once nino of us at table, when there were no more than seven small
lettuoe leaves swimming 10 1100301, but not a drop of oil 10 make them
slip down. Ja. But did your landlord eat all his gray psas 1111000111
Gi. You must know there was 0001000 farthingworth of them; how·
ever, hadid 001 absolutely forbid those that sat next him to taste thern,
butitlooked unciviltorob asick 100001111011010010. Ja But wera
not your lettuoe leaves split to make the greater showl Gi. Why,
truly, they were not3 but when those that sat at the upper end 01 the
table had eaten up the leaves, the rest sopped their broad in the vinegar.
Jo. But what, I pray, came after these lettuoe leavesl Gi. What!
what should come but oheese, the last dish at dinnerl

Ju. But was this your daily 10101 Gi. Generally speaking, it
was ; but now aud then, 11 the old gentleman had the good luck to get
money in the way 01 trade that day, he would be 0 little more genereus.
Ja. How did you 1010 111001 Gi. Why, then he would send out to
buy a pennyworth 01 fresh grapes, at nine bunches a penny 3 this made
the whole family sing Ο be joyful. Ja. Why 0011 Gi. But then
you must understand too, that this was never but when grapes were
dog-oheap. Ja. What, 11100, did he never launch out but 10 00101001
Gi. Yes, he will thus launch 001 01 some other times too; for you
must know that there 010 follows that catch 0 small sort 01 shall-fieb
10001 commonly on tho shores, and cry them about the streets, and he
would now and then buy au halfpennyworth 01 these; then you would
swear there had been a wedding-dinner in the family. There was 0
fire made in the kitchen, though not very much 01 11 neither, for these
do not ask much boiling ; and these dainties come always after the
cheese instead 01 0 11000011. Jo. A very fine dessert, indeed! But
do you never 00010 11010001110011 01110111

Gi. Α11001 1110 old gentleman being overcome by my clamouring,
began to live a little more nobly 3 aud wheuever he had a mind 10
011011 his generosity in good 0010001, this was our bill of fare. Ja.
Ilong to hear what 11101 is. Gi. Imprimis, we had a dish 01 soup
which they call a service, but Ι do not know why. Ja. A 1011 rich
one, I suppose. Gi. Very high sessoned with the following spicas :—
They took you a large kettls of water, and 001 11 0101 the fire; into
