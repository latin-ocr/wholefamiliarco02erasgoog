not want power to arenga themselves for the wrong done to them.
Peter, being turned out of his church, can shut the gete of the kingdom
of heaven against you3 Paul has 1 swerd, and st. Bartholomew a knife.
The monk William 1111 1 1011 01 mail,under his habit, and 1 heavy
lance too. And how will you encounter St. George on horseback, in
his cuirassier's arms, his swerd, and his whinyardl Nor is Anthouy

without his weapon ; 1111111 his sacred fire. And the rest of them have
either their arms or their mischiefs, that they can send out against
whom they pleese. And 11 101 myself, although Iwear no weapons,
you shall not turn ma out unless you turn out my Son too, whom Ι
hold in my arms. Ι will notbe pulled away from Him; you shall either
throw us both out 01 leave us both, unless you have 1 mind to have 1
ehurch without a Christ. These things Ι would have you know, and
consider what answer to gire me, for Ι have the matter much at 111111.

From our Stone House, the Calends of
August, the Year of my Son’s Pession,
1524. 1, the Stony Virgin‚ have sub
scribed this with my own hand.

Me. In truth, this is a very terrible threatening letter, and Ibe
lieve Glaucoplutus will take care what he does. 09. Ha will, if he is
wise. dle. But why did not honest James write 10 him about this
ruatterl 09. TrulyI cannot tell, except it is because heisa great
way off, and newa-days 111 letters are intercepted. Me. But what
wind carried you to Englandl 09. A very favourable wind, and Ι
had made half a promise 10 1111 beyond-sea she-saint to pay her another
risit within two or three years. Me. What did you go to ask for of
herl 09. Nothing new but those common matters, the health of my
family, the increase of my fortune, along and 1 happy life in this
world, and eternal happiness in the next. Me. But could 1101 our
Virgin Mary have done 11 much 101 you 111111 She has 11 Antwerp a '
temple much more magnificent than that beyond sea. 09. Ι will not
deny 11111 she is able, but one thing is bestowed in one place and
another thing in another ; whether this be her pleasure merely, 01
whether she being of 1 kind disposition, accommodatos herself in this
10 our affectione.

dfe. I have often heard of James, but, prithee, give me some
account of that beyond-sea lady. Op. Ι will do itas briefly as Ι can.
Her name is very famous all over England, and you shall scarce find
auybody in 11111 island who thinks his affairs can be prosperous unless
111 every year makes some present to that lady, greater or smaller,
according aa his circumstances are in the world. Me. Whereabouts
does she dwelll Oq. N ear the coast, upon the furthest part between
the west and 1111 north, about three miles from the sea ; it is a town
that depende chiefly upon the resort of strangara There is a college
0111110111111111, to which the Latine have added the name 01 Regulam,
which are 01 1 middle sort between monks and those canons that are
called Seculars. Me. You tell 1111 01 amphibious creaturos, such as the
beavers are. 09. Nay, so are crocodilea too. But trifling apart‚I
will 1111 you in three words: in odious cases they are canons, in
favourable cases 'they are monks. 11 e. You have hitherto been telling

1111 riddles. Op. Why, then,I will give you 1 mathematieal demon·
