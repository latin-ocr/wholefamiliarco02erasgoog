150 FAMILIAR corcuculus,

a tortoise from under his shell. Him you must ask if you 00011010
any lodging there, if he does not say no, you may take it 101 granted
that there is room 101 you. When you ask where the stable is he

, points to it ; there you may curry your horse as you please yourself,

forthere is no 00110111 will put 0 hand to it. 1111 bea noted inu,
there is a servant shews you the stable and a place for your horse, but
incommodious enough, 101 they keep the best places 101 those that shall
come afterwards, especially for noblemen. Ι1 you find fault with any-
thing they tell you presently, 11 you don't like look for another iun. ln
their 011100 they allow hay, but very unwillingly and sparingly, and
thetis almost 00 dear 00 0010. When you have taken care 01 your
horse, you come whole into the 01010, 110010, baggnge, dirt, and all, for
that is a oommon room 101011 comere. Will. In Franoe they appoint
you a separate chamber, where you may change your clothes, clean and
1001110011101110.οἐ110, ,011 ,n a
your boots, put on your shoes, and, if you will, change ¹your shirt, hang
11111111011111111111111111101111111
as 101 the oleaniiess 01 1111111101 the most 11011 such that yyou will bant
another water to wash that off. 11111. Ι commend 1110001101 people
that have nothing 01 effeminacy in them. Bert. 11 yon come iu at
four o'clook in the 0110111000, you must not go to supper till nine, and
sometimes not till ten. Will. Why so‘l Bert. They never make

anything ready till they see all their company together, that one Δ

trouble may serve for 011. Will. They are for taking the shortest
wa .

yBert. You are right 3 00 that 0110111101εο there 001110 011 together
into the same stove eighty or ninety 1001111011, horsemen, merehauts,
1001111010, waggoners, husbandmen, children, women, siek and sound.
Willffhis is having all things in common. Bert. There one combs
his head, another wipes off his sweat, another cleans'his spatterdashes
01 110010, another belches garlic, and, iu short, there is 00 great a cou-
fusion of tongues and persons as thore was at the building the tower 01
Babol. And 11 they see any person 01 another country, who by his
habit looks like a nran 01 quality, they all stare at him 00 wistfully aa
if h'e was a sort 01 strange animal brought out 01 Africa. And when
they are aetat table, and he behind them, they will be still looking
back at him, and be staring him iu the face, till they have forgot their
suppers. Will. At Rome, Paris, 01 Venice there iano person thinks
anything strange.

Bert. In the meantime, it is 00111110 101 you 10 0011101 anything.
When it is grown pretty late, and they dou’t expect any more guests,
out 0011100 011 old gray-bearded servant, with his hair out short, and a
crabbed look and a slovenly dress will. Such fellows ought 10 be
eupbearers to the cardinale at Rome. Bert He having east his eyes
about, counts to himself how many there are in the stove ; the more
he sees there the more lire he makes in the 01010, although it be at a
time when the very heat 01 the sun would be troublesomo; aud this¹
with themis accounted a principal part 01 good entertainment to make
them all sweat till they drop again. lf any one who is not used to the
