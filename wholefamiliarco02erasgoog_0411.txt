pleasure who, as is commonly uccounted, follow nothing but pleasures.
First of all, their minds are polluted and vitiated with the leaven of
lusts, thet if anything that is pleasant happens, it presently grows
bitter3 for when a fountain is muddy the stream will not run clear.
rigam, that pleasure is no true pleasure thetis received with a dis·

disease has forsaken the mind. Sp. Ι (10 not deny that.

Hc. But lostly, these pleasnres proceed from false goods, whence
it follows that they are but cheats; for what would you say if you saw
a man under a delusion by magioal arts, to, drink, danos, clep his
hands, when there was nothing really there that he thought he sawt

present at such a spectacle ; thero was a certain priest skilled in magio
Sp. He did not learn that from the Holy Scriptores. Ile From the
most unholy ones. Some ledies of ¹the court paida visit to this priest,
inviting themselves to dine with him, and upbraiding him with covet·
ousness and niggardliness3 at last he consented and gave them an
invitation. They came without a breakfast, that they might eat the
heartier dinner. The table seemed to be plentifully furnished, and no
‹lainties wanting, and they fed heartily, and returning their host
thanks for his entertainment‚ went home. But immediately they
perceived themselves very hungry, and wondered that they should be

in common to grasp at the mere empty shadows of good, instead of the
true and substantial goods, and to take a plecsure in those deceits that
