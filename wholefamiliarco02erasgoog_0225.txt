'when a certain person, taking notice 01 his abstaining from wine, said
= to him, that wine would be very cheap if all mon drank 00 he did;
Nay, says he, in my opinion it would be very dear if all men dranlr it
0011111111, 101 I drink as much as 1 plesse. Ge. Iwish our John
Botzemus, the canon of Constance, was here; he would look like
another Romulus to us: 101 ho is 00 abstemious as he is reported to
bavebeen3butneverthcless,hoisagood-humoured,facetiouscompanion.
. Po. But come on, 11 you can, I will not say drink and blow, which
Plautus says 10 0 hard matter to ‹103 but if you can eat and 1100101 000
and the samo time, which is a very easy matter, Iwill begin 1110
exorciso of tolling 0101100, and auspiciously. If the story be not a
pleasant one, remember it is a Dutch one.

1 suppose some of you have heard of the name of Maccus! Ge.
Yos, he 1100 not been dead long. Po. He coming once to 1110 city 01
Leyden‚ and being 0 stranger thoro, had a mind to 10010 himself 10100
notice 01 101 00 arch 11101 (101 that was his humour); he goos into a
shoemaker's shop and salutes him. The 0100100101, 1100110110 10 0011
1110 wares, 00101110 what ho would buy. Maccus setting his eyes upon
a pair 01 110010 that hung up there, the shoemaker askod him 11 he
would buy any boots. Maccus assenting 10 11, he looks out a pair 11101
would fit him, and when he had found them brings them 0111 very
readily, and, 00 tho usual way is, drawa them on Maccus being very

doublesoled shoes agree with 111000 1100101 Tho 0100100101 0010 him
if he would have a pair of shoes too. He assents3 a pair is looked 0111
presently and put on. Maccus commende the boots, commenda tho
shoes. The shoemakor, glad in his mind to 11001 him talk 00, soconds
him as he commended them, hoping 10 got a better price, since the
customer likod his goods 00 woll.

And by this time they were grown a little familiar ; then says
Maccus, Tell mo, upon your word, whether it never was your hap, when
you had fitted 0 man with boots and shoes, as you have me, 10 have
him go away without paying for theml No, never in all my life, says
ho. But, says Maccus, if such a thing should happen to you, what
would you do in the 00001 Why, quoth the shoemaker, 1 would 1110
after him. Thon says Maccus, 1101010 you in jest 01 in earnestl In
earnest, says the other, and Iwould doit in earnesttoo. Says Maccus,
I will try whether you will 01 00. See I run for the 011000, and you
010 10 follow me, and out he 11100 10 0 minute; the shoemaker follows
him immediately 00 1001 00 0101 110 could run, crying out, Stop thies,
stop thief. This noise brings tho people out 01111011 11011000. Maccus,
laughing, hindors them from laying hold of him by this device, Do not
01011 me, says he, we 010 running a 1000 101 0 anger of 0110101 ale ; and
00 they all stood still and looked on, thinking 1110 0100100101 had
craftily made that outcry that ho might have the opportunity to get
before him. At last the 0100100101, being tired with running, givos
00111011 goes sweating, puffing, and blowing home again: 00 Maccus

ott 0 rizo.

thief Po. Why sol Ge. Because he carried the thief along with
him. Po. Perhaps he might not have money 01 that time, but paid
