THE PROFANE BANQUET. 73

mean by thatl Aa. Because fish eating, by its corrupt humours,

renders the body liable toa great many discusse, that it cannot subserve ’

the spirit as it should do. Oh.. Το what diseasesl Au. Gouts, severs,
leprosies, the king’sevil. cl. How do you knowl Aa. Ι believe
physicians. Ihad rather do so than try the experiment. Ol. Perhaps
that happens to a few. Aa. Indeed Ι believe to a great many besides,
rinasruuch as the mind acts by the material organs of the body, which
are affected with good or bad humours‚ the instruments being vitiated,
it cannot exert its power as it would. Os. Ι know doctors do very
much find fault with the eating of fish, but our ancestors thought other-
wise, auditis our duty to ohey them.

‘ Ἀτι. It was a piece of religion formerly not to break the Sabbath3
but for all that, it was more eligible to savea man on the Sabbath
day. Ol. Every oue consults his own health. Aac. If we will
obey St. Paul, let nobody mind his own things, but every one the
things of another. ol. How come we by this new divine at our
tablel Whence comes this new upstart master cf oursl Aa. Be-
cause Ι don't like fishes. Ob. What, then, will not you abstain from

fleshl Aa. Ι do abstain, but grumhlingly, and to my great detri· ⁴

ment tce. cl. Charity suffers all things. Aa. It is true3 hut
then the same requires but little. If it suffers all things, why will
not it suffer us to eat those ments the gospel has given us a liberty
to eatl Why do those persons, from whom Christ has so often re-
quired the love of Himself, suffer so many bodies of men to be
endangered by capital diseases, and their souls to bc in danger of
eterual damnation, because of a thing neither forbidden by Christ
nor necessary in itselfl Oli. When necessity requires it, the force
ef a human constitution cesses, and tho will cf the lawgiver ceases.
Aa. But the offense of the weak does not cease. The scruple of a
tendor conscie-nce does not oease. And lastly‚ it is uncertain with
what limita that necessity shall be bounded ; shall it be when the lish-
eater shall be a giving up the ghostl It is too late to give flesh
to a man when hc is dying ; or shall it be when his body becomes
all severishl The choice of meats is not of so much consequence.
Oh. What would you have prescribes] thenl Aa. Ι can tell well
enough, if 1 might he allowed to be a dictator in ecclesiastical affairs.
Ol. What do you mean by thatl ·

Aac If Ι were pope Ι would exhort all persons to a perpetual
sobriety of life, but especially before an hely-day3 and moreover, Ι
would give every one leave to eut what he would for the health of
his body, so he did it moderately and with thanksgiving, and I
would endeavour that what was abated of these observatione should
be made up in the study of true piety. ol. That in my opinion
is of so great weight, that we ought to make you pope. Aa. For
all your laughing, this neck could bear a triple crown. Oh. But

' in the meantime take care that these things be not entered down

in the Sorbcnne at Paris. Aa. Nay, rather let what is said be written
in wine, aa it is fit those things should that are said over our cups3
but we have had divinity enough for a feast. We are at supper,
not at the Serbonne. Cla. Why may not that be called Sorbonne where
we sup plentifully! Aa. Well, let us sup then, and not disputa
lest the Serbonne be called after us from ambis, and not from sorbenda
