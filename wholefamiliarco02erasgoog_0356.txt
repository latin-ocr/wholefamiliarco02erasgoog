THE SOBER BANQUET. 349

if a man was dead it would fetch him to lile again Gy. If it was
possible Ι would add to your hyperbole. Je. Upon my word, all
things look wonderfully pleasant. Jo. In short, this gardan ought to
he dedicated with a drinking match. La Our dames speaks much
to the purpose· At. This place has been formerly initiated with such
ceremonias. But 1 would have you observa hy the way, that I have
nothing here to make you a dinner, except you will be content with a
collation without wine Iwill treat you with lettnces without either
salt, vinegar, or oil ; here is not a drop os wine but what flows out of
this sountain. I have here neither bread (tc eat with the saled) nor
cup (to drink ont of). And the season of the year issuch that it is
more proper sor leading the eyes than the belly. Ba. But I suppose
you have got playing tables or howls3 we will dedicate the gardan with
playing, il' we cannot with feasting.

Αἱ. Since there is such a set of jolly fellows oi us met together,
I have something to propose as to the consecration of the gardan that‚1
am of opinion, you will confess is far before either gaming or banqueting.
et. What is thatl Al. Let every one furnish hisquota,and1dare
engage we shall have a noble and delicate feast AEm. What can we
furnish, that are come hither unprovidedl Al. Unprovided, who
have your intellectuale so well furnished! Fr, We long ιο hear
what you would be at. ΑΙ. Let every one produce the neatest obser-
vation that his week's reading has furnished him with. Gy. Very
well proposed ;.nothing can be more agreeable to such guests‚ such

o ow ou.

Ad If you agree to it I will not stick out. Iwas mightily pleased
today to find ao Christian-like a sentence in a man who was no Chris-
tian ; it was that of Phocion, a man than whom there was not a more
divine one, nor more regardful oi the public utility in all Athena·
When he had been invidiously sentenced to death, and was about to
drink his poison, being asked by his friends what message he had to send
to hia children, he answered, he only required of them that they would
ever banish this injnry out of their memorias Bo. Yon will acarce
find an example oi such notahle patience amongst either the Dominicans
or Franciscans. And 1 will present you with one instance that is
something like this, though it does not come up to it. Aristides
was very like Phocion for integrity, so that the common people gave
him the surname of the Just ; which appellation raised him so much
ttlh‘ltltltttlttr‘ltltthtttiltsskttfftltltl’
stood that the people were offended at nothing hut that appellation,
though that had always been to their advantage, he patiently suh
mitted. Being in hanishment‚ his friends asking him what punish·
ment he wished to the ungrateful city, he replied, 1 wish them
nothing, but so much prosperity that they may never once rememher
Aristides

Ol. I wonder that Christiano are not ashamed of themselves, that
are in a rage upon the occasion of every triiling affront, and will have
revenge‚ eost it what it will. The whole life of Socrates, in my
opinion, is but one continued example of temperanoe and patience.

And that ¹I may not be scot-irae, Ι will mention one instanoe that
