THE RELIGIOUS BANQUET. 93

envy, and other iniquities, they thought they merited heaven, because
that upon holydays they visited the temple, offered sacrifices, abstained
from forbidden meets, and frequently insted—embracing the shadow 01
religion and neglecting the substance. But in that He says, “I will
have mercy und not sacrifice,” I take it to be said according to the
idiom 01 110 Hebrew tongue—that 10 10 say, mercy rather than sacrifice,
00 Solomon interprets it in this text, “ To do mercy and judgmcnt is
more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifices.” And again, the Scripture

ceremonies, and has any affinity with Judaism, such as are the choice 01
meats ,appointed gemente, fasting, sacrifices, the saying over 01 prayers
as a b'oy says his lesson, resting upon holydays. These things, as they
are not 10 10 neglected in their due sanson, so they become displeasing
tc God, is a man, relying too much upon these observances, shall neglect
to do acts 01 mercy as osten as his brother's necessity requires it.
And it has some appearance 01 holiness in it 10 avoid the conversation
01 wicked men. But this ought to give place as 011 aethere isan

reconciled to my brother is a point 01 mercy.

And then as 101 judgment, though that may seem to respect
persons in power, who ostentimes oppress the weak therewith, yet it
seems reasonable enough, in my opinion, that the poor man should
remind him 011101 in Hosea, “And the knowledge 01 God more than
burnt offerings.” Numan can 10 said to keep the law 01 God but he
that keeps it according to the mind 01 (lod. The Jews could lift up an
ass upon the Sabbath that was fallen into a pit, and yet calumniated
our Saviour 101 preserving a man upon that day. This was a pre-
posterous judgment, and not according 10 110 knowledge 01 God, 101
they did not consider that these things were made 101 man and not
man 101 them. But Ι should have esteemed it presumption in me to
have said these things 11 you had not commanded it, and I had rather
learn 01011010 things more apropos.
