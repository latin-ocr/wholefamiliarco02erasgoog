THE RELIGIOUS BANQUET. 96

and therefore often abstains from things lawful, rather choosing to

condescend 10 what is for another’s advantage than to make use 01 its ¹

own liberty. But now here arises 0 double difficulty; first, that herc
is nothing that either precedes or follows 11 the context that agrees
with this sense. 101 he ehides the Corinthia-ns for being seditious,
fornicatore, adulterers, and given to go to law before wicked judges.
Now what coherence is there with this 10 say, “All things are lawful .
for me, but all things are not expedientl” And in the following
matter he returns to the case 01 incontinence, which he had also
111111111191111111111111111131131ἰῖ11111111111
for ille bddy.”’ But, however, this sciuple may bc solved too, because ⁶
a little before, in the catalogue of 0110, he had made mention 01
idolatry: “Be not deceived, neither fornicatore, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers.” Now the eating 01 things offered 10 idols is a certain kind
01 idolatry, and therefore 110 immediately subjoins, “ Meet is for· the
belly, and the belly 101 meat.” Intimating that in a case of necessity and
for 0 000001 0 man may eat anything, unless charity toward his neigh-
bour shall dissuade it; but that 111010011000 10 11 all persons and 01 011
times to be detested. Itis matter 01 necessity 11101 we eat, but that ,
necessity shall bc taken away at the resurrection 01 the dead. But if
we are lustful‚ that proceeds from wickedness.

But there 10 another scruple that Ι cannot tell how to solve 01
how 10 100010110 10 that passage: “But Ι will not be brought under
the power 01 any.'' 101110 says he has the power 01 011 things, and
yet he will not be brought under the power 01 any 010. If he may be
said to be under another man’s power that abstains for 1001 01 offend-
ing, it 10 what he speaks of himself in the ninth chapter: “ For though
Ι be free from all men, yet have made myself servant 10 011, that I may
gain ali.’' St. Ambrose stnmhhng, Ι suppose, at this cample, takes
this to be the apostle’s genuine sense for the better understanding of
what hc says in the ninth chapter, where he claims 10 himself the
power 01 doing that which the rest of the apostles (either true 0110100)
did 01 receiving a maintenance from them to whom he preached the
gospel. But he sorbore this, although he might have done itas a
thing expedient among the Corinthiens, whom he reproved for so many
and enormous iniquities. And, moreover, he that receives is in some
degree in the power of him from whom he receives, aud suffers some
kind 01 abatement in his authority. For he that takes cannot 00 freely
reprove his benefactor, and he that gives will not so easily takes
reprehension from him that he has obliged. And in this did the
Apostle Paul abstain from that which was lawful for the credit of his
apostolical liberty, which in this case 110 would not have to be rendered
obnoxious to any one, that he might with the greater freedom and
authority reprehend their vices. Indead, I like this explicatior of
St. Ambrose very well.

But yet, 11 anybody had rather apply this passage 10 meets, St.
Paul’s saying‚ “ butI will not be brought under the power 01 any,” may

110 taken in this sense : Although I may sometimes abstain from meets '

offered to idois, or forbidden by the Mosaical law, out of regard to the
salvation 01 my brothors’ souls, and the furtherance 01 the gospeI, yet
my mind is 1100, well knowing that it is lawful to eat all 1101101 01
