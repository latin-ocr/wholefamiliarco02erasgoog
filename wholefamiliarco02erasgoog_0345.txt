338 FAMILIAR conlocutus,

is our common friend, who is no negligent observer of these things, in
some oi his proverbe upon the authority of the ancients, intimatas some
things of the play of the tali3 as in the proverb, Noa chius red cous,
he says, that the cous and the siae were the same that the Greeks called
ἐξήτην. Ηο relatas the semein the proverb cicius ad cous (adding that
chiae was the same with οοηίο, the ace). That the cast of the cous was
a lucky cast, but oi the canis an unlucky one, according to the testi-

mony of Persius:
Quid dexter senio ferret

{epae apat in votis, damnosa canicula quantum
ere .

And likewiae Propertius,
Semper damnosi subsiluere canes.

And Ovid, in his second book ‘fide Tristibus,'’ calls them damnosos

camhnd Martia} adds, that the aize by itself is alucky cast3 but if

an ace comes up with it, unlucky; for so ho speaks,
Senio nec nostrum cum cane quassat ebur.

And now as to Venus's cast, as it is what happens but very
{pipperpg pp it is a very lucky threw: as Martial writes in his “ Apo.

Oum steterit vultu nullus tibi gratus eodem,
Munera me dices magna rna dedisse tibi.

For they playod with as many tali as every ono had sides ; for as to
dice, they used to play but with three. But that which Suetonius
writes of Octavius Augustus comes nearer to the method of play,
reciting out of a carmin epiatle oi his to Tiberius z At supper we played,
both yesterday and toduy, like old grave men, at tali; and aa any one
threw an ace or a aize he laid down a piace of money for every talus,
and he that threw venus took up all. 'Qu You told me before that
it was a very fortunato throw when any one threw four different sides,
as at dice-play the most fortunate cast is midas; but you did not tell
me that this cast was called venus. ola Lucian will make that
matter plain to you: thus, speaking couceruing Cupide, xci βαλῶνμέν
ἐπι σκοποῦ, μάλιστα δὲ εἴποτε wira θεὰν αὐτὴν εὐβολήσειε. Μεδενὸς
ἀστραγάλου πεσόντος ἴσω xlmam, ποσεκΰνει τῆς ἐπιθυμίας τεῦξεσθοι
νομίζων. He thore speaks of venus. Qu. If Theodorus is mistaken‚
his worda only make mention of two sides. ol. It may be he followed
the authority of some author that is out of my memory3 but I have
quoted what I find in authors. For there aro some that speak of the
stesichorian number as to the tali, which they take to be the number
eight3 and also of the euripidian, which contained forty. Qu But it
remains that you lay down the rules of the play.

ot I am not of the opinion that boys made use of the same rule
that Octavius writes he obscrved. N or is it probable that this garns
which he speaks of was acommon one; if that had been so, it had been
enough for him to have said, After supper we played at the tali. But
be seems by this to hint that it was a new method that they bad
