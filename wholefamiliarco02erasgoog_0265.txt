mine. What is the matterl Bu. I will tell you if you do not know.
Here is a time coming upon you that you and your brother tradesmen
will be 011 starved to death, and ready to hang yourselves out 01 the

Ha, ha, now it has come out at last: the kettle 00110 the pot black. la
there any part 01 0 butchcr 01001101 and swecter than his baohsidel I

fancies.

Ba. What Ι 1011 you is too 11110 to make ajest on But, prithee‚
how do you promise yoursell a better trade upon this considerationl
Fi Because people are 01 that humour that they are most desimus of
