opinion it does. Bu. Then neither by counsel nor exhortation do we
avoid the snare. Fi. Nay, it is not admonition, but the argument 01
admonition that brings into the snare. For if Ι admonish my brother
to make use 01 slippers‚ and he does net do it, he is not guilty of a
crime.

Ba. I will not put the question at this time how far the prescrip
110110 01 physicians are obligatory. Doce a row lay liable to the pain
of eternal damnationi Fi Yes, Ba. What, all kind of vowel Fi.
Ay, all universally, if they be possible, lawful, and voluntary. Bu.
What do you mean by voluntaryf Fi. That which is extorted by no
necessity. Ba What is necessityl Fi. Fear fallingupon a man of

constancy. Bu. What, upon a Stoic, such a one as Horace says, lf ·

the world fall to pisces about his ears he would 1101 be 01101111 Fi.
Shew 1110 such a Stoic, and then I will give you an answer. Ba. But,
without jesting, 0011 the fear of famine or infamy fall upon a man of ’
constancyl Fi. Why 11011

Bu. Suppose 0 daughter 11101 10 not at hor own disposal should
marry privately‚ without the consent of 1101 parents, who would give
their consent if they knew it, will the vow be lawfulf Fi. It will.
I cannot tell whether it be or no; but this I am sura 01, 11 there be
any such this is one of the number of those which, although they be
true, yet lest they be a scandal to the weak‚ are 10 be kept secret.
Ba. Again, suppose 0 virgin who, by her parents’ consent, has engaged
herself in marriage 1ο her lover should enter herself in 1110 0101010101
111. 0101011111 this vow be allowable and 10111111 Fi. Yes, if· it he
a solemn one. Bu. (lan that be solemn that is done in a field and a
dark monasteryl Fi. It is acoounted so. Bu. Supposc the same
person 01 1101110, 0 few witnessos being present, should make a vow 01
perpetual virginity, will it not be a lawful vow' 1 Fi N o. Ba.
Why 001 Fi. Because 0 more holy vow is in the way. Bc. lf the
same maid sell 0 field, will 1110 001111001 be goodl Fi. I think not.
Bu. And will it be valid if 0110 give herself into 1110 power of 0110111011
Fi. If she devote herself to God.

Bu. And does 1101 0 private row devote a person 10 God? and
does nothe 11101 receives the holy sacrament 01 matrimony devote
himself to Godl and can they whom God has joined together devote
themselves 10 the davil, when only of married persons God has said,
Whom God has joined, let no 111011 put asunderl And besides this,
when a young man not come of age and 0 simple maid, by the 11110010
01 parents, severity 01 1111010, the wicked instigation of monks, 1011
promises, and terrifyings‚ are thrust into 0 nunnery, is 1110 vow 0 1100
10111 Fi. Yes, 11 they are at years of discretiori. Bu. A virgin 01
that age is emphatically doli copas, being easy 10110 imposed upon.
What if Ι should purpose in my mind to drink no wine on 0 Friday,
would my purpose bind me 00 strongly as a vow‘l Fi. Ι do not
think it would. Ba. What difference is there then between a deter-
minate purpose and 0 vow conceived in 1110 mindi Fi. The mind 01
binding. Bc. You denied but just now 11101 the mind signified
anything in this matter. Do Ι purpose if Ι 0111 able, and vow whether
I 01110110 0111011 Fi. You 1101011 Bu. Have 111 Ι have clouds
painted upon the wall that ia just nothing at all What, then, is the
ratio of the matter to be disregarded in a purposel Fi. 1 11111111 so.
