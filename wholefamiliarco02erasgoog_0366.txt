therefore, means that itis tha part of an abject mind, and not that
exalted mind of Christ, to swerve asida to the fictitious apparitions of
angele, and it is tha part of a mean mind to be led about by every· ³

bodys persuasion. Hero you see that ταπεινοφροσύνηίε used in a
bad sense. Le. Isee it.

Hi. Again, in the same chapter, “After the commandments and
doctrines of men, which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-

worship and humility.'' Here again ταπεινοφροσύνη is used in a bad
sense. Lo. It is plaiu Hi. Again, in l Peter v. it is used for thet
virtue which is contrary to pride, τὴν ταπεινοφροσύνην ἐγκομβώσασθε,
for· which we read “ be elothed with humility.'’ And again, m Philip-
pians ii, τῇ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ ἀλλήλους ἡγούμενοι ύπερχοντας ἑαυτῶν,
“ ln lowliness of mind let every one esteem another better than hinr-

self.” Le. You have made it out that ταπεινοφροσύνηίο used both
ways, when the Romans use „adoria only by way of commendation;

but can you prove that ταπείνωσις is used for modestyf Hc'. There
is no absurdity in using of it so. There is nothing hinders but that
we may attribute submission and lowliness to the mind 3 but whether
or no it bc so used in the holy scripturos I cannot tell Le. Consider if
St. James uses it in that sense or not, James i 9, 10, “Let the
brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted, but the rich in that
he is made low.”

Hi. In thot place it is ἐν ταπεινώσει, not ταπεινοφροσύνῃ. And
if you will needs have it, that here humility is taken for modesty, it
follows of consequence that we must take exaltation for pride, and
then arises a twofold absurdity. Foras he is no modest man that
bcasts of his modesty and braga of himself, so also he is doubly arro-
gant that glories in his pride. Le. What, then, does the apostle
meanl Hi. He commands equality among Christians. The poor
man is said to be loW, in that he is of a meaner fortune, the rich man
is said to be high in the eye of the world, because of the splendour of
his fortune. This rich man debases himself to the condition of a poor
man, and the poor man is raised to be cqual with the rich mam They
have both of them something to glory in-the one rejoioas in his helping
the necessity of the poor with his ricbes 3 the other glories in the name
of Christ, that He has inspired suche spirit into the rich. Le. But all
this while the rich man enjoys the commendaticn of his modesty too.

115. Perhaps ho may, but it does not thence follow that ταπείνωσις
signifies modesty. For there are some persons who bestow a great deal

man, when it is not burdensome to him, for Christ’s sake, to be made
equal with the poor3 and the poor men, that he does not become
puffed up with the honour conferred upon him, but, giving thanlrs to

Christ, glories in Him. Itis beyond disputo that ταπείνωσις is fre-
quently used in the boly scripturas to signify that lowliness of mind
or dejectiori which proceeds from affiiction or infirmity. Thus Paul, iu

Philippians iii, ‘⁴ Who shell change our vile bodies,” ταπεινώσεως. In
like manner in Psalm ix. 13, “ Consider my trouble which I suffer of

them that hate me,” ταπείνωσιν. And again, in Psalmi. 28, “ This
