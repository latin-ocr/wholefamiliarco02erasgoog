as a lord, reviling his neighbour with notorious lies, impoaing upon his
poor neighbour with manifest frauda, heis not at all shocked at 11101.
Fi So if any 000 0000 0 Francisoan with a girdle without knots, or an
Augustino girt with awoollen one instead 010 leather one, or 0 Carme·
lite without 0110, or a Rhodian with one„ or a Franciscan with whole
shoes on his feet, 01· 0 Oruciferian with half-ahoes on, will he not set
the whole town into an uproarf Bo. There were lately in our
neighbourhood two women, whom one would take for persons 01
prudenoe, and the one miscarried, and the other fell into a fit on seeing
a canon, who was a president 01 the nuns in a cloister not 101 distant,
appear out 01 doors without a surplice under his gown. But the same
women have frequently seon these sort of cattle junketting, sin'ging

Fi. Perhaps some allowanco ought to be made for the sex. But Ι
suppose you know Polythresius. He was dangerously ill, hia distem·
per was a consumptiou. The physicians for a long time had persuaded
him to 001 eggs and milk-meats, but to no purpose.⁴ The bishop
exhorted him to do the like ; but he being 0 man of learning, and a
bacheler in ‹livinity, seemed to resolve rethor 10 die than to take the
advice 01 either of these physioians. At last the doctore, and his
friends together, contrived to put the cheat upon him, making him a
potion of egge and goats¹ milk, telling him it was juiee of almonds.
This he took very freely, and for several days together mended upon it,
till a certain maid told him the triek, upon which he fell to vomiting
01 11 up again. But the very same man that was so superstitious in
1010110010 milk, had 00 little religion 10 him, that he forswore a sum
01 money 11101110 owed me, having got before an opportunity to tear
the note of his hand that he had given me; he forswore it, and I was
obliged to 011 down with the loss. But 110 took not the cath with so
much difficulty, but 11101 110 seemed to wish he had such complaints
made against him every day. What 000 be more perverse than such a
spirit 1 He sinned against the mind of the ohurch in not obeying the
priest and the doctore. But he whose stomach was 00 weakin rola-
tion to milk had 0 0000010000 strong enough 00 10 perjury.

Bu. This story brings to my mind what I heard from a Dominican
in a full auditory, who upon Easter 010 was setting out the death 01
Christ, 11101 he might temper the melancholiness 01 his subject by 1110
pleasantness 01 1110 story. A certain young man had got a nun with
child, and her great belly discovered her fault A jury 01 1111110 were
impannelled, and the lady abbess 001 as judge 01 1110001111. Evidence

she was obliged to plead the unavoidabloness 01 the crime, and defended
the fact upon that consideration3 also transferring the blame to another,
having recourse to the Status Qualitatis, 01· 11 you will rather have
it so, the Status Translationis. I was overcome, says she, by one that
was too strong for 010. Saye the abbess, then you should have oried
out. So Ι would, says the prisoner, had it not been 0011010 10 make a

confessed there are 0 great many foolisher things than this done.
