gete him, and make him a present ef some rare turnips. Conon at
first would not hear 01 it, saying he should lose his labeur, for that
princes took no notice 01 such small matter-⁸3 bnt his wife over·
persuaded him. Conon picks eat a parcel 01 ehoicc turnips, and gete
ready 101 hisjourney3 but growing hungry by the way, sats them all up
but one very large one. When Cenon had got admission inte the hall
that the king was to pass through, the king knew him presently, and
sent 101 him ; and 110 with a great deal 01 cheerfulness effers his pre·
sent, and the king with as much readiness 01 mind receives 1100111-
manding one that stood near him te lay it up very oarefully among his
greatest rarities. He commanda Conon te dine with him, and after
dinner thanks him5 and Cenon being desirous to ge back into his
own country, the king orders him 1‚000 crowns for his turnip.

When the repert 01 this thing, as it is common, was spread abroad
through the king's househeld servants, ene 01 the courtiers presente
the king with a very fine horse. The king knowing that it was his
liberality to Conon that had put him upon this, he hoping to make a
great advantage by it, 110 accepted it with a grean deal ef pleasure, and
calling a council 01 his nobles, began to debete with what present he
should make a recompence for so fine and valuable a horse. In the
meantime the given 01 the horse began te be ssushed with expectation,
thinking thus with himself, Ι1 he mede such a recompence 101 1 poor
turnip offered him by a country 11111101, how much more magnificently
· will he requite the present 01 10 fine a horse by a courtierl When ene
answered one thing, and another another to the king that was consult-
ing about it as a matter 01 grem moment, and the designing courtier
had been fora long time kept in fools' paradise, at length, says the
king, Itis just now come into my mind what return te make him, and
calling one 01 his noblemen to him, whispers hirn in the ear, bids him
go fetch him what he feund in his bedchamber (telling him the place
where it lay) choicely wrapped up in silk ; the turnip is brought, and
the king with his own hand gives it the courtier, wrapped up as it
was, saying that he thought he had richly requited the present 01 the

' horse by so choiee 1 rarity as had eost him 1,000 crowns. The Ι

courtier going away and taking eff the covering‚ did not find a eoal
instead 01 1 treasure, according to the old proverb, but a dry turnip 3
and so the biter was bitten, and seundly laughed at by everybody inte
the biiffiirt, Mr. King, 11 you will please to permit me, who am but

comes into my mind, by hearing your story concerning the same Leuis 3
101 as ene link 01 a chain draws on another, so 0110 story draws en
another. A certain servant aeeing a leuse crawling upon the king’s
coat, falling upon his knees and lifting up his band, gives notice that
he had a mind to do some sort of service. Lenis effering himself to
him, 110 takes eff the lousa and threw it away privately3 the king asks
him what it was; he seemed ashamed to tell him, but the king urging
him, he confessed it was 1 leuse. That is 1 very good sign, says he,
for it shews me te be a man, because this sort 01 vermin particularly

haunts mankind, especially while they are young, and ordered him a
