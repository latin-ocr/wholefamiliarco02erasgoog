ΤΗΕ REHGIOUS BANQUEY. 87

But the oolour in the picture seems not to be natural. Ea. Why sol
Ti. It seems too pale, methinks, sor those in Italy are blacker. Eu.
Don’t you know the herb it has fallen uponl Ti. Not very well.
Idea That is no wonder, for it does not grew in these parts. Itis
wolfe-bane, so deadly a poison, that upon the very touch of it a
scorpionis stupefied‚ grows pale, and yields himself overcome; but
when he is burt with one poison he seeke his remedy with another.
Do you see the two sorta of helleboro hard byt If the scorpion can
but get himself clear of the wolfe-bane, and get to the white hellebore,
he recovers his former vigour, by the very touch of a different poison.
Ti. Then the scorpion is undone, for he is never like to get off from
the wolfe-bane. But do scorpione speak heret Eu. Yes‚ they do,
and speak Greek too. Ti. What does he sayl aa. Εὗρε θεὸς τον

ἆλιτρόν, “ God heth found out the guilty.” Here, besides the grass,
you see all sorta of serpente. Here is the besilisk, that is not only ·
formidable for his poison, but the very flash of hie eyes is also mortal.
Ti. And he says something too. Ea. Yes‚ he says, Oderint, darn
metuont-Let them hate me, so they fesr me. Pi. Spoken like a
king entirely. sa. Like a tyrant rather, not at all like a king.
Here a lizard fights with a viper, and here lies the dipsas serpent upon
the catch, hid under the shell of an estridge egg. Here you see the
whole policy of the ant, which we are called upon to imitate by
Solomon and Virgil. Here are lndian ants, that carry gold and hoard
it up. Ti. Oh, good God! how is it possible sor a manto be weary
of this entertainmentl Eu. And yet at some other time you shall
seeI will give you your bellyful of it.

Now, look before you at a distance: there is a third wall,
where you have lakes, rivers, aud sees, and all sorte of rare fishes.
This is the River Nile, in which you see the delphin, that natural
friend to mankind, fighting with a crocodile, man's deadly enemy.
Upon the banks and shores you see several amphibious creaturos, as
crabe, secla, beavcrs. Here is a polypus, a catcher caught by an
oyster. Fi. What does he say, αἱρῶν alpisum, the inker taken-
rt. The painter has made the water wonderfully transparent. Eu.
If he had not done so we should have wanted other eyes. J ust by
there is another polypus, playing upon the face of the sea like a little
cock-boat; and there you see a torpedo lying along upon the sande,
both of a colour; you may touch them here with your hand without
any danger. But we must go to something else, for these things feed
the eye, but not the belly. Ti. Have you any more to be seen, thenl
Ea. You shall sce what the backside affords us by and by.

Here is an indifferent large garden parted. The one a kitchen
garden, that is my wife‘s and the family’s; the other is a physic
gardan, containing the choicest medical herbe. At the left hand there
is an open meadow, that is only a green plot enclosed with a quickset
hedge. There, sometimes, I take the air, and divert myself with good
company. Upon the right hand there ie an orchard, where, when you

have leisure, you shall see a great variety of foreign trees that I have .
brought by degree· to endure this climate. Ti. Oh, wonderful! the
king himself has not such a seat. Ea. Aa the end of the upper welk
there ie an aviary‚ which I will shew you after dinner, and there you
will see various forms and hear various tongues, and their humours
