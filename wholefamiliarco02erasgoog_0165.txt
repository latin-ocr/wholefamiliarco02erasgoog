158 FAMILIAR COLLOQUIES.

It is customary to drink water after figs, lest they clog the stomach.
Here is very cool clear spring water that runs out of this fountain,
that is good to mix with wine. Or. But Ι cannot tell whether I had
best to mix water with my wine, or wine with water, this wine seems
to me so likely to have been drawn out of the muses’ fountain. Hi.
Such wine as this is good for poets to sharpen their wits. Yon dull
follows love heavy liquor-s. Cr. Ι wish I was that happy Crassus.
H ι’. I had rather be Codrus or Ennius. And seeing Ι happen to have
the company of so many learned guests at my table, lwill not let them
go away without learning something of them. There is a place in the
prologue of Eunuchus that puzzles many, for most copies have it thus:

Sic existimet, sciat,
Responsum, non dictum esse, quia loesit prior,
eri bont vertendo, et eas describendo malt, dre.

“ Let him so esteem or know, that it is an answer, not a common
saying ; because he first did the injury„ who by well translating and ill
describing them,” dc.

In these words Ι want a witty sense, and such as is worthy of Ter·
enee. For he did not therefore do the wrong first, because he translated
the Greek comedies badly, but because he had found fault with Terence‘s.
Eu. According to the old proverb, he that sings worst let him begin
first, When Ι was at London, in Thomas Linacre’s house, who isa
man though well skilled in all manner of philosophy, yet he is very
ready in all criticisms in grammar, he shewed me a book of great
antiquity which had it thus :

Sic existimat, sciat,

Responsum non dictum esse, quale sit prius
Qui bene vertendo, bt eas describendo male,
Ex Graecis bonis Latinas fecit non bonas ε
Idem Menandri phasma nunc nuper dedit.

The sentence is so to be ordered, that quale ait may shew that an
example of that which is spoken before is to be subjoined. He
threatened that he would again find fault with something in his
comedies who had found fault with him, and he here denies that it
ought to seem a reproach, but an ansver. He that provokes begins
the quarrel; he that being provoked replies, only makes his defenee or
answer. He promises to give an example thereof, quale ait being the
same with οἷον in Greek, and quod penus, velati, or videlicet, or puta in
Latin. Then afterwards he bringsa reproof‚ wherein the adverb prius
bath relation to another adverb, as it were a contrary one, which follows,
via, nuper, even as the pronoun qui answersto the word idem. For he
altogether explodes the old comedies of Lavinius, because they were
now lost out of the memory of men In those which he had lately
published, he sets down the certain places. Ι think that this is the
proper reading and the true sense of the comedian, if the chief and
ordinary poeta dissent not from it. Ga. We are all entirely of your
opinion uu. But 1 again desire to bo informed by you of one small
and very easy thing, how this verse is to be scanned-

Ex Graecis bonis Latinas fecit non bonas.
