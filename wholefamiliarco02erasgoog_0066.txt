schoah EXEROISES AND PLAY. 59

As Ovid says:

Nescio qut natale solum dulcedine cunctos
Ducit, et immemores non sinit esse sui.

‘'‘ Pray tell me how did you find all things there.”

Anu Tamus new-rna Fortu—Pa. Nothing but what was new.
All things changed, all things become new. See how soon time changes
all human affairs. Methought Ι came into another world. I had
scarce been absent ten years, and yet I admired at everything‚ as
much as Epimenides, the prince of sleepers, when he first waked out of
his sleep. Cb. What story is thatl what fable is thatt Pe. I will
tell you, if you are at leisure. Oh. There is nothing more pleasant
Pe. Then order me a cheir and a cushion. Ch. That is very well
thought on, for you will tell lies the better sitting at ease. Pe. His·
torians tell us a story of one Epimenides, a man of Crete, who, taking
a welk alone by himself without the city, being caught in a hasty
shower efrain, went for sheltcr into a cave, and there fell asleep, and
slept on for seven-and-forty years together.

I Dors'r estrsvn 1r-r11s Foru—Oh. What a story you tellt It
is incredible. What you say is not very likely. Youtellmeafiotion.
I dou't think it is true. You tell me a monstrous story. Are you not
ashamed to be guilty of so wicked a liei This is a fable fit to be put
among Lucian’s legende. Pe. Nay, Ι tell you what is related by
authors of credit, unless you think Aulus Gellius is not an author of
approved credit. Uh. N ay, whatsoever he has written are oracles to
me. Pe. Do you think that a divine dreamed so many yearsl for it
is storied that he was a divine. Ca. I am with child to hear.

Tne Assera-Pe. What isit morethanwhat Scotusand the school-
men did afterwardsl But Epimenides,he came off pretty well,he came to
himself again at last; but a great many divines never wake out of their
dreams. Gt. Well, go on„you do like a poet, but go on with your lie.
l’e. Epimenides, waking out of his sleep‚ goes out of his cave and looks
about him, and sees all things changed—the woods, the banks, the
rivers, the trees, the fields 3 aud, in short, there was nothing but was
new. He goes to the city und inquires ; be stays there a little while,
but knows nohody, nor did anybody know him. The meu were
dressed after another fashion than what they were before, they had
not the same countenances, their speech was altered, and their manners
quite different. N or do I wonder it was so with Epimenides, after so
many years, when it was almost so with me, when I had been absent but
a few years. Ch. But how do your father and mother dol Are they
livingi Pe. They are both alive and well, but pretty much worn out
with old age, diseases, and lestly, with the calamities of war. Ch. This
is the comedy of human life. This ie the inevitable law of destiuy.

Wosns: Nanss or Aremtha—Pe. Will you supet hometodayl
Ch. I am to sup abroad; Ι must go out to supper. Pe. With whoml
Ch. With my father-in·law, with my souin-law, at my daughter-in-
law's, with my kinsmen, They are called affines, kinsmen, who are
allied not by blood, but marriage. Pe. What are the usual names of
affinity‘l Ca. A husband and wife are noted names.

Socer, Is my wife's father.

Genea My daughtefs husband.
