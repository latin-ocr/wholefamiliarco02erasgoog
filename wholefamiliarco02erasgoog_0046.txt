ready to fly when you went away, but you are come limping home.
Thr. 1 1111 come back likea soldier then Ha. You a soldier, that
. would outrun a stag 11 an enemy were at your heels. Thr. The hope
’ 01 booty made me valiant Ha. well, have you brought home a good
deal 01 plunder theut Thr. Empty pockets. Ha. Then you were
the lighter 101 travelling. Thr. But Ι was heavy leden with sin.
Ha. That is heavy luggage indeed, 11 the apostle says right, who calls
sin lead. Thr. Ι have seen and had a hand in more villanies this
mphhhn ldldiwndld1 11111111111011911(011)(111η(11ῗ110111111 ly lWhhdfTheere is no course 01
life in the world more wicked or more wretched. Ha. What then must
be in the minds 01 those people that 101 the sake 01 1 little money, and
some out 01 curiosity, make as much haste to a battle as to 1 banquetl
Thr. In truth, Ι can think no other but they are possessed; 10111 the
devii were not in them they would never anticipato their fate. Ha. So
one would thiuk3 101 if you would put them upon any honest business,
they will soarce stir 1 foot in it for any money. But tell me, how went
the battlet who got the better 01 itt Thr. There was such a hallec
ing, hurlyburly, noise 01 guns, trumpets, and drums, neighing of horses,
and shouting 01 men, that Ι was so far from knowing what others were
a doing, that Ι scarcely knew where I was myself. Ha. How comes it
about then that others, alter a fight is over, do paint you out every
circumstance so to the life, and tell you what such 111 officer said, and
what the other did, as though they had been nothing but lookers on
all the time, and had been everywhere at the same timet Thr. It is
my opinion that they lie confoundedly.' Ι can tell you what was done
in my own tent, but as to what was done in the battle, I know nothing
st all 01 that. Ha. Don't you know how you came to be lame neither 1
Thr. Scarce that, upon my honour, butI suppose my knee was lrurt by
a stone, 01 ahorseheel, orso. Ha. Well, butI ean tell you. Thr.
You tell me! Why, has anybody told youl Ha. No, but Ι guess.
Thr. Tell me, then. Ha. When you were running away 111 1 fright,
you fell down and hit it against 1 stone. Thr. Let me die 11 you have
not hit the 11111 on the head. Ha. (lo, get you horne and tell your wife
01 your exploits. Thr. She will read me a juniper-lecture 101· coming
home in such 1 pickle. Ha. But what restitution will you make 101 Ι
what you hare stolenl Thr. Thet is made already. Ha. To whoml
Thr. Why, to whores‚ sutlers, and gamosters. IIa. Thetis like a
soldier 101 111 the world 3 it is but just that what is got over the devil’s
back should be spent under his belly. Ha. But I hope you have kept
your fingere 111 this while from sacrilegat Thr. There is nothing
sacred in hostility; there we neither spere private houses nor churches.
Ha. How will you make satisfactionl Thr. They say there is 110
satisfaction to be made 101 what is done in war, 101 111 things are lawful
there. Ha. You mean by the 1110111111, Isupposel Thr. Youare
right. Ha. But that law is the highest injustice. It was not the love
01 your country, but the love 01 booty that made you a soldier. ⁸ Thr.
Iconsess so, and Ι believe very few go into the army with any better
desigu. Ha It is indeed some excuse to be mad with the greater part
01 mankind. Thr. Ι have heard 1 parson say in his pulpit that war
was lawful. Ha. Pulpits indeed are the oracles 01 truth. But war

may be lawful 1011 prinoe, and yet not so 101 you. Thr. 1 have heard
