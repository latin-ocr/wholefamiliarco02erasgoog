THE UNEASY WIFE. 133

lkncw you know Gilbert the Dutchman. Xe. I know him. Eu.
He, you know, in the prime of his age married 6 gentlewoman well
stricken in years, and in 6 declining age. Xa. It may be he married
the portion, and not the woman. 116. 86 11 was. He having 66

61616166 16 his wife, was over head and ears in love with a young
woman, with whom hs used ever and anon 16 divort himself abroad.
He very seldom either dined or supped at home. What would you 11616Ι
done if this had been your 6666, Xantippel Xa WhyI would have
16161116116161611611111616161166116161116611,6611 I would have washed
him well with 6 chamber-pot when 116 was going to her, that he might
have gone thus perfumed 16 his entertainment. 1111. Β111 how much
more prudently did this gentlewoman behave herself. She invited his
mistress home 16 her house, aud treated hen with all the civility
imaginable. 86 she kept her husband without any magical charms.
And if at any time he supped abroad with her, she sent them thither
some nicety 61 other, desiring them to 116 616111 together. 116 Α6
161 616, Iwould sooner 6116666 16 1666 my life than 16 be bawd 16 161
own husband.

116. But in the meantime, pray consider the matter soberly and
ooolly. Was not this much better thanis she had by her ill temper
totally alienated her husband's 6116611666 11616 her, and spent her whole
life in quarrelling and brawlingl· X 6. Ι believe 1116161 two evils it
was the least, but I 6611111 6616111616 submitted 16 11.

hc. I will add 6116 16616, and thenI will have done with examples.
A next door neighbour 61 6616 16 6 very honest, good man, but 6 little
too subject to passion. One day he beat his wife, a woman 61 66111-Ι
mendable prudence. She immediately withdraw into 6 private roem,
and there gave vent to her grief by 16616 and sighs. 8666 61161, upon
some occasion, her husband 66166 1616 the rocm and found his wife all in
tears. What is the matter, says he, that you are crying and sobbing like
achildi To which she prudently replied‚ Why says shehis it not much
better 16 1661661 my misfcrtune 1161611166 if Ι should make 6 bawling
in the street, as other women dol ’1116 man's mind was 66 616166166
and mollified by this ausser, so like 6 wife, 11161 giving her 1116 hand, Ι
he made a solemn promise to his wife that he would* never lay his hand
upon her after as long 66116 lived. Nor did he ever do it. Xa. I
have obtained 66 much from my husband, 11111 by a different conduct.
116. But in the meantime there are perpetual wars between you.

X 6. What 111611 would you 11616166 to dol 116. 11 your husband
611616 you any affront, you must take 6ο notice of it, but endeavour 16
gain his good will by all good offices, courteous carriage‚ and meekness
61 spirit, and by 111666 methods you will in time either wholly 16616161
him, or at least you will live with him much more easy than you now
do. Xe. Ay, but 11616166 ill-natured 16 116 wrought upon hy all the
kind offices in the world

Eu. Hold‚ don’t say 66, them 16 66 116661 that is so savage but 116
11161 be tamed by good management ; therefore do not despair 61 116616
a man Do but make the experiment 161 6 few months, and 11 you do
not find that this advice has been 61 benefit to you, blame me. And
there are also 16166 1611116 that you must wink at, but above all things
itis my opinion you oughttc avoid everto hegin any quarrel eitherin the
bed-chamber or in bed, and 16 take a special 6616 that everytbing them
