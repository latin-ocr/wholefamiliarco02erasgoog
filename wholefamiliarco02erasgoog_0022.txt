PREFAOE. xv

understanding, yet there is a stupid generationes 1000 whom the
French 0011 1011010111 and 10111110 reason, as 1 suppose, because they
are but diminutively polite who speak thus 01 my Colloquies‚ They are
0 work to be shunned‚ especially by monks, whom they term 1110
religione, and by young men, because the 10111 and abstinences 01 the
church are therein 101 light by, and the intercession 01 1110 blesscd
Virgin Mary drolled upon 3 and that virginity is not comparable to a
marriage state,and because all are dissuaded from antering upon religion,
and because in it the hard and difficult questions 01 divinity are pro-
pounded to weak grammarians‚ contrary 10 1110 orders swern 10 by the
masters 01 0111. Candid reader, you are not unacquainted with the
Athenian eloquence. 1111011 first give an 0111110110 the last 01 111010
objections. As to what the masters 01 011 propound to their pupils Ι
know not. The matters treated of in my Colloquies concerning 1110
010011, 1110 mass, fasting‚ vows, and confession, contain nothing 01
theological difficulty3 but they are 01 that kind that every one ought
to be acquainted with. And besides, 1001111111οΕ111111010111110111
are read to boys, what danger 10 there in giving them a taste 01
theological disputatione? And further, whereas they know 11101
the intricate questions of greatest difficulty (1 do not say 01 vain
subtlety) concerning the divine persons 010 very early propounded
to young studente iu sophistry, why are they not willing that boys
should learn that which concerns 00100100 11101 And now, if this be
their opinion, itis no matter what is said in 1110 person of such or such

0 one; then they must suppose that 111010 010 many things 111 the ,

writings 011110 evangelista, and 01 the apostles, which, according 10 this
rule, are downright blasphemy. In many places I approve 01 10111011,
ond nowhere condemn it. He that shall assert the contrary, lwill
declara him to be an impudent liar. But, say they, in the Childish
Piety there 010 these words [1 have nothing to do with fasting]. Suppose
these words were spoken in the person 010 soldier, 010 drunkard, does
Erasmus 01 necessity condemn fastingl I think not. Now they 010
spoken by a youth not yet arrived 01 that age from which the law
requires the observation 01 10111; and yet that youth properes himself
for fasting rightly; for 110 proceeds thus, But yet, if Ι find occasion, 1
dine and sup sparingly, that I may be more lively for spiritual exer-
cises on hely-days. And how Ι condemn abstinency, these words in
the Profane Fcast declara : In a great many circumstances it is not the
thing but the mind that distinguishes us from J ews; they held their
hands 110111 certain 1110011, 01 00010011 things that would pollute the
mind ; but we, understanding that to the pure all things are pure, yet
take away food from the wauton 11011101 wo do hay from 0110011101οἀ
horse, that it may be more ready 10 1100111011 10 1110 spirit. We 101110-
111001 chastise the immoderate use 01 pleasant things by the pain of
abstinence. And 0 little after he gives a reason why the church has
forbidden the eating 01 certain meets. Το 1110 question, Το whom does

the injunction do good l says he, Το 011 ; 101 poor folks may eat cockles
01 frogs, or gnaw upon onions 01 100111. The middle sort 01 pcople will
make some abatement in their usual provision ; and though the rich do
make it an occasion of their living deliciously‚ they ought to impute that
to their gluttony, and not blame the constitution 01 the church. And
again I speak thus, lknow (1001010 do very much find fault with 1110
