IOHTHYOPHAGIA; OB, risu-Ermaia. 285

bawl, danae, figbt, play at dice at the churehdoor‚ so that you cannot
hear what the parson says when he is premhing, and this is no offenoe
Fi. A wonderful perversity of judgment!

Ba Ι will tell you another story not much unlike this. It is now
almost two years since tho same Eros went for the sake of his bealth
to Ferventia, and I, out of civility‚ bore him company. He went to
an old friend’s house who had given him frequent invitatione by
letters. He was a great man and one of the pillars of tha ehurch.
When they came to eating of fish, Eros began to ba in his old condi-
tion, a whole troop of distempars were coming upon him—a fever,
severe headache‚ vomiting‚ and the stone. His landlord‚ though he
saw his friend in this danger, did not dare to give him a bit of 111111-
meat. But whyl he saw a great many reasons that he might do it,
he saw likewise the pope’s licenoe ; but he was afraid of publio censure,
and the disease had grown so far upon him that then it was in vain to
give it him.

Fi. What did Eros (101 Ι know the man’s temper; he would
sooner die than be injurious to his friend. Bu. He shut himself up
in a chamber, and lived three days after his own manner ; his dinner
was one egg, and his drink water and angar boilcd. As soon as his
fever was abated he took horse, carrying provision along with him.
Fi. What was itt Bu. Almond milk ina battle, and dricd grapes
in his portmanteau. When he camo home the stone seized him, and
he lay by it for a whole mouth. But for all this, after he was gons,
there was a very hot but a false repert of eating flesh followed him,
which reached as far as Paris, and a great many notorious lies told
about it. What remedy do you think proper for such offencesl Fi.
Ι would have everybody empty their chamber-pots upon their heads,
and if they happen to meet them in the street, to stop their noses
while they go by them, that they may be brought to a sense of their
madness.

Ba. I think truly the divinos ought to write sharply against such
pharisaical impiety. But what is your opinion of his landlordl Fi.
He seems to be a very prudent man, who knows from what frivolous
causes tha people excite such ‹lismal tragedias. Bu. This may indeed
be tha effect of prudence, and we may interpret tha good man’s timor-
ousness as favourably as isay be; but how many are there who in the
like case suffer their brother to die, and pretend a cautiousness to aot
against tho usage of the ehuroh and to the offence of the people,
but have no fear upon them of aeting to the offenee of tha people iu
living a life publiciy scandalous in rioting, whoring, luxury, and idle·
ness, in the highest contempt of religion, in rapine, simony, and
cheatingl Fi. Thera are too many such, that which they call piety
is nothing but a barbarous and impious cruelty. But yet methinks
they seem to be more eruel who do not leave a man in danger ocea-
sionally, but invent dangers for him, and force many into them aa into
a trap, into manifest danger of both body and soul, especially having
no authority for it. Ba. I wait to hear what you have to say.

l m. About thirty years ago Ι lived at Paris, in the collega called
ἰ Vinegar Collega. Ba. That is a name of wiadom. But what say
you‘l did a saltfishmongcr dwell in that sour collegal No wonder
