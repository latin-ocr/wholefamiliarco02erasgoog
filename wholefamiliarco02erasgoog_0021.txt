which dictatas that this or that fraternity should ba so respected, that
tha common profit of Christiana should be neglectedl

In the Colloquy οι the Difference οι Names and things, I find fault
with the preposterous judgmont of some.

In the Unequal Fecst, I shew what is agreeable ιο civility.

In Charon Ι sbew my abhorrence of war among Christiana.

In the Assembly of Grammarians Ι deride the study οι a certain
(larthusian, very learned ιιι his own opinion, who, whereas it was bis
custom foolishly to rail against the Greek tongue, hath now put a Greek
title to his book; but ridiculously calling them Anticomaritae, whom ho
should have called Antemarians, or Antidiccmariana.

In the (lyclops I reprove such as bave the gospel ιιι their mouth,
when nothing like tho gospel appears ιιι their livea

In the Unaqual Marriage Ι set forth tho folly οι pcoplo in common,
when in matching their daughters they have regard ιο the wealth‚ but
disregard the pox of the bridegroom, which is worse than any leprosy.
And that now-adays is so common a raotice that nobody wonders at
it, although nothing can be more cruci against their children.

In the Falso Kni gbt Ι describe a sort of men who, under tho
cloak οι nobility‚ thinkg they may do anytbing, which is avery great
plagae to Germany.

In the Parliamcnt οι Women I was about ιο reprehend some of
the vices of women, but civilly, that nobody might expect anything
like what rs in J uvcnal But while Ι was about this, the kniglrt witlr-
out a horso presented itselt', according to the old saying, cTalk of the
davil and he appears. The restare ιιι a manner all composed sor
diversion, and that not dishonest, which 1s not ιο defamo the orders,
but to instruct them. Wherefore it would bc more to tbe advantage
οι all the orders, both privately and publicly,1 isthey all would lay ·
asido the rago οι reviling, and would with candour οι mind embrace
whatsoever is offered with an honest intention for the public good.
Ono has one gift and another has another, some are taken with one
thing and some wit th anot t,har and thero are at thousand ways ιγ which
men are at ttracted to piety. Tho study οι duvencus' rs commended,
who published the Histoe os tlte sacred Gospela aa Versa And Arator
is not without his praises, who did the same by the Acts of the Apostles.
Hilary blew the trumpet against heretica, Augustino argues sharply,
Jeromo argues by way oi dialogus, Prudentius maintaius tho combat
in a various kind of verse, Thomas and Scotus light with the auxili
aries οι logic and philosophy. Their studies have the same tendenoy,
but the mathod οι each rs different. That diversity rs not to be blamed
that tends ιο the same end. Peter the Spaniard is read to boys, that
they may be the better prepared to read Aristode, for ho hath set
them a good step sarwards that hatb given them a relish. But this
book, if it be first read by youth, will introduce them to many useful
parts οι science-to poetry, rhetoric, physica, and ethios; and lastly, ιο
those things that appertain to Christian piety. I have taken upon mo
to sustain the person oi a fool, in blazoning my own merit 3 but Ι have
been induced ιο ιι partly by the malicc cf some who roproach every·
