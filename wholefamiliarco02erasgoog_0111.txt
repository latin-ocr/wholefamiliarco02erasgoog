by somemeans 01011101 give us clothes too. Therefore, relying upon
His bounty, we have no reason to disquiet ourselves with anxiety 01

this world as though we used it not, we transfer our whole study and
application to the love 01 heavenly things, and rejecting the world and

Ι 1110 devil universally, with all his 010110 delusione, we 0110011111Ιο serve

God 010110, who will never forsnke His childrenl ,

But all this while 1101010 nobody touches the fruits. Certainly
you may eat this with joy, 101 this is the product 01 my own 101111, and
did not eost much 0010 10 provide it. Ti. We have very plentifully
0011011011 our bodies. Ila. I should be glad 11 you had satisfied your

our bodies.

Ea. Boy, take away, and bring some water. Now, my friends, let
uswash, that 11 we have in eating contracted any guilt, being oleansed,
we may conclude with a'hymn. 11000 plesse, Ι will conclude with what
Ι began out 01 St. chrysostom. Pi. We entreat you that you would
do it. 110. “ Glory to thee, O Lord3 glory to thee, 0 Holy One3 glory
10 thee, Ο King ; as thou 11001 given us meat 101 our bodies, 00 replenish
our souls with joy und gladness in thy Holy Spirit, that we may be
found acceptable in thy sight, and 11100 1101 be made ashamed when

1110 holy blood from the tyranny 01 1110 devil, and 110111 taken us to
Himself. Secondly, we style Him Holy, because He being the
sauctifier 01 011 111011, 1101 being content alone to have 110010 pardonod
