· THE CANONIZATION OF JOHN REUCLIN. ’ 109

that he might ease my mind of my trouble by his discourse For when

my friend was sick, Iwas sick too, for 1 loved him as my own father.
Po. Phoo t there is nobody but loved him, except ho were a very bad
man indeed.

Br. My Franciscan says to me, Brassicanua, leave off grieving, our
Reuclin is well. What, said Ι, is he well all on a sudden, thenl F or
but two days ago the doctore gave bat little hopes of him. Then, says he,
he is so well recovered that he will never be sick again. Don't weep,
says he (for he saw the tears standing in my eyes), before you have
heard the matter out. 1 have not indeed seen the man this six days,
but Ι pray for him constantly every day that goes orer my head.
This morning after matins, Ι laid myself upon my conch, and fell into
a gentle pleasant slumber. Po. My mind presages some joyful thing.
Br. You have no bad guess with you.

Methought, says he, Ι was standing by a little bridge that leads
into a wonderful pleasant meadow3 the emer-ald verdure of the grass
aad leaves afl'ording such a charming prospect, the infinite beauty and
variety of the flowers, like little stara, were so delightful, and every-
thing so fragrant, that all the fields on this side the river, by which
that blessed field was dirided from the rest, seemed neither to grew
nor to be green, but looked dead, blasted, and withercd. And in the
interim, while I was wholly taken up with the prospect, Reuclin, as
good luck would have it, came by; and as he passed by, gave me his
blessing in Hebrew. He was gotten half way over the bridge before Ι
perceived him, and as Ι was about to run to him, he looked back, and
bid me keep off. You must not come yet, says he, but five years hence
you shall follow me. In the meantime do you stand by a spectator
and a witness of what is done.

Here Ι put in a word ; says I, Was Reuclin naked, or had he clothes
on, was he alone, or had he companyl He had, says he, but one gar-
ment, and that was a very white one; you would have said it had
been a damask, of a wonderful shining white, and a very pretty boy
with wings followed him, which 1 took to be his good genius. Po.
But had he no evil genius with himl Br. Yes, the Franciscan told
me he thought he had. For there followed him a great way off some
birds, that were all over blaek, except that when they spread their wings
ι they seemed to have feathers of a mixture of white and carnation.
He said that by their colour and cry one might have taken them for
magpies, but that they were sixteen times as big, about the aize of vul-
tures, having combs upon their headS, with crooked beaks and gorbellies.
lf there had been but three of them, one would have taken them for
harpies. Po. And what did these devils attempt to dol Br. They
kept at a distance, chattering and squalling at the hero Reuclin, and
were ready to set upon'him if they duret. Po. What hindered theml
Br. Turning upon them, and making the sign of the crosa with his
hand at them, he said, Begone, ye cursed fienda, to a place that is
fitter for you. You have work enough to do among mortale, your
madness has no power over me, that am now listed in the roll of im·
mortality. The words were no sooner out of his mouth, says the
Franciscan, but these filthy birds took their flight, but left such a stink ,
. behind them, thata house of office would have seemed oil of sweet
ursrjoram or ointment of spikenard to it. He swore he had rather
