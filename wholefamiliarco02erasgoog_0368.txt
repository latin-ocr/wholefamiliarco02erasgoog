merit, for Horace denies that himself was te be called happy in that
he was adopted into tho number ef Maecenas’s friends. H i Why sol
La Because it was the effect of judgment, and net mere farem.
Maecenas rendered this te him because he adjudged it due to his merit

Hi. And to the same perpessis that which follows r “ Ter He that
ismighty hath done te me great things, and hely is His name.’' She
has said hely instead ef glorieus. By how much we arrogata to our
own merita, by se much we detract from the glery ef the divine being.
For, as St. Paul says, “His power is made perfect in our weakness.’' And
immediately, in the same verse, “He hath deposed the mighty from their

scats, and exalted the men of lew degree.” Not ταπεινόφρονας, but

venerreio—ia, that He may eppese the despised in the eye of the
world to men of power. The sequel explains this verse after the
manner of the prephet's speaking, “The hungry hath He filled with
good things, but the rich hath He sent empty away.’·' These who just
now were called men of low degree, here are called hungry—that is,
poor 3 these who in ene place are called mighty‚ are here called rich
men. In the next werse there is mention made ef mercy diffusing
itself through all the natiens of the world In the last verse she
makes mention ol her confidence in (lod's promises, “As He heth
s eken,’' dac. Threugheut the whole song there is a setting forth the
giery—that is, the power, the goodness, and truth ef God. There
is no mention at all made of merite.

La. But as pride commonly accempanies power and siches, se
percrty teaohes modesty. Hi. 1 de net deny that it sometimes so

If you deny that, 1 shall instance to you the many Mordards that there
are in the world. But, fer once, supposeI allow it, though it is net
always so. The question is not here, what sort ef persen the most
hely mother of Christ was, but what she says ef herself in this eengl
La. Ι admire at the obstinacy of those persons who have been so often
refuted and laughed at for their solly, and that they are net brought
to a recantatien. Hi. How often have they beon told that declama·
tien is the treating on a fictitious theme went to be made use of to

· exercise the faculty of speaking, and yet their sermons are nothing else

but declamatiensl How often have they been told that he is a
bacheler that has ne wife, though he keeps six hundred concubinee‘l
and yet they will have it that celibacy is only continenoy and chastity.
It is· the same as te humility, and a great many other things.

Le. Whence proceeds this obstinate stupidityl Hi. 1 answer
you, Ι say it proceeds from the Mardards that are in the world. They
never would be at the pains to learn when they were young, nor have
they any books ner opportunity to learn3 and if they have wherewithal
to furnish themselves with learning, they had rather lay it eut upon
their bellies. They think the sanctity ef their garmentis enough in
conscience to gain them a reputation for piety and learning. And, in
the last place, they think it is some part of religion to knew as little
