these ests

ff. But hear what the Franciscan told me besides. While Ι was
int upon these things, says 100110οο00 was come close to the
bridge, and saluted Reuclin in these words, (101 save thee, my most
holy companion, 1 am ordered 10 conduct thee to the mansione 01 110
1100001 00010 above, which 110 divine bounty has appointed thee as
areward for thy most picus labonrs. With that, he took out a
garment, and put it upon Revclin.

Thon said Ι, Tell me in what habit 00 form St J erome appeared ;
was he so old as they paint himl Did he wear a cowl or a hat, or the
garb 01 0 cardinal, 00 101 10 0 lion by his sidet Nothing 01 011 11000,
said he; but his person was comcly, which made his age appear such
as carried in it much comeliness, but nc deformity. What need 101
10 10 have a lion by his side, as 10 10 commonly paintedl His gown
came down 10 110 10010, as transparent as crystal‚ and 01 110 same
fashion 01 1101 10 gave to Reuclin. It was all over painted with
tongues 01 three several colours-some imitated rabies, some emeralds,
and others sapphircs-and beside the clearness of it, the order set it 011
very much. Po. An imitation, Ι suppose, 01 110 three tongues that
he professed. Br. Without doubt: for he said that upon the very
borders 01110 garments were the charactcra 01 11000 three languages
inscribed in their different 0010000.

Ρο. Hud J erome no company with himl Br. N 0 company, 10

the air aa thick as those little corpuscles they 0011 atoms fly in the
sunbeams, pardon the meannees 01 110 comparison. 11 they had not
100000 transparentas glass, there would have been no heaven nor
earth to have been seen. Po. Oh,b1ave‚1am glad with all my heart
100 Reuclin’s sake3 but what followedl

Br. J evome, says he, 100 honour’s sake giving Reuclin the right
hand, and embracing him, 00010010 him 1010 110 meudcw, and up 0
hill that was in the middle 01 11, where they kissed 001 embraced 000
another again. In the meantime, the heavcns opened over their heads
to a prodigicus wideness, and there appeared a glory ac unutterable 00
made everything else that passed 100 wonderful before tc look mean
and sordid. Po. Cannot you give us some representation 01 111
Br. N0; how should I, that did not 000111 Ηο who did see it says
that he was 001 0110 10 express the very dream 01 it. He said 10

moment. Po. How thenl Br. Out 01 1110 00001000 01110 heavens
there was let down a great pillar 01 fire that was transparent, 001 01 0

And after this there followed a wonderful fragrant smell. When
