upon it. Mc. Nay, rather venture your tail. Ι lrnow there is but
little dependente upon your word; but, however, I will try this time
what credit may be given to you; if you deceive me now, you shall
never obtain anything from me again. Let them play; but let them
keep together ln the field; don't let them go a tippling or worse
exercises, and see they come home betimes, before sunset. Coc. We
will, sir.

Ihave gotten leave, b'ut with much ado. Jer. Ο brave lad!
we all love you dearly. Uoc. But we must be siue not to transgress
our orders, for if we dc, it will bc all laid upon my back3 Ι have eu·
gaged for you all, and if ye do, I will never be your spokeaman again.
Jer. We will taho care. But what play do you like besti Coe. We
will talk of that when wc come into the fields.

Nicltolos aad Jerome.

Pnarmu ar Rham—Nic. No play is better to exercise all parts of
the body than stoolball; but that is litter for winter thau summer.
Jer. There is no time of the year with ue but what is fit to play iu.
Nic. We shall sweat less if we play at tennis. Jer. Let us let nets
alone to fishermen3 it is pretticr to catch it in our hands. Nic.
Well, come on,I don't much matter, but how much shall we play
forl Jer. For a fill-up, and theu we shall not lose much money.
Nic. But I had rather sparo my corpus than my money. Jcr. And
l velue my eorpus more than my money. We maist play for something,
or we shall never play our best. Nic. You say truc. Jcr. Which

hand soever shall get the first three gamos, shall pay the sixth part '

of a great to the other, but upon condition that what is won shall be
spent among all the company alike.

Nic. Well, Ι like the proposui, come, done, let us choose huuds;
but we are all so equally matched that it is no great matter who
and who is together. Jer. You playa great deal better than Ι.

pertners Ι would have. Nic. And we like our partners very well
Jcr. Come on, now for it, he that will win must look to his gamo,
let every one stand to his place bravely. Do you stand behind mc
ready to catch the ball if it goes beyond me3 do you mind there, and
beat it back when it comes from our adversaries. Nic. Iwill war-
rant ye I will hit it if it comes near me. Jer. Go on aud prosper,
throw up the ball upon the house. He that throws and does not
speak first, shall lose his cast. Nic. Well, take it thou. Jcr. Do
you tosa it ; if you throw it beyond the bounds, or short, or over the
house, it shall go for nothing, and we will not be cheated: and truly
you throw nastily. As you toas it, I will give it you again ; Ι will
give you a Roland for au Oliver3 but it is better to play fairly and
honestly. Nic. It is best at diversion to beat by fair play.

Jer. It is so, and in war too; these arts have each their respective
lawa. There are some arts that are very unfair ones. N ic. I believe
so too, and more thau seven too. Mark the bounds with a shell, or
briclrbat, or with your hat, if you will. ἄεν. Iwould rather do it
with yours. Nic. Teke the ball again. Jer. Throw it ; acore it up.
