upon themselves very dangerous distempers. But when he found me
supporting my outward tabernaclo, that was 1611311611, starved, 66111116-
tempered, with some knick-knacks that were sold at the confectionem,
he sets a physician, 6 friend and acquaintance os mine, to persuade me
to live moderately. The doctor took a great deal 61 pains with me. I
soon perceived he had been set on to 11161166, I made him not a word
6166661611 ‘

But when he was still 1113163 166 very hard, and was always harp
ing on the same string, Ι 66111 16 him, Worthy doctor, pray tell me, 616
you in jest or in earnestl Oh, in earnest, said he. Well then, replied
I, what would you have 1116 16 dol Why, to leave off suppara 161 36611
and all, and 16 mix at least one-hall water with your wine. Ι could
not forbcar laughing 61 11116 excellent advice, and said to him, ,1f you
want to 666 166 decently laid ina ohurchyard, you propose a ready way
161 11; 161 Ι 616 6616 11 would be present death to me, in the circum·
stances 61 this poor, 1666, dispirited body, to leave off suppers; and 1
have tried that 66 often, that in short 1 have no mind to 1661161116
experiment again. What, pray, do you think would become 61 1116, 11,
61161 such dinners 66 we have here 1 should go supparless to bedl

’ And theuto bid me mingle water with such weak insipid wine l pray,
tell me, is it not much better to drink clear water 11616 the spring
than to dcbauch it with this sour drcggy stuff l I do not doubt but
Orthrogonus put you upon giving me this advice.

At this the doctor smiled, and allowed me better terms. Most
learned Gilbert, said he, I did not say 1111616 you, that you should
totally leave off eating suppers ; you may cat an 633 and drink a 31666
61 wine, 161 this is my own manner 61 living. I have an 633 boiled for
my supper-one-half 61 the yolk 1 eat 11136611, and give the other 1161116

’ my 666 ; thenI drink half a 31666 61 wine, and by the help 61 this

refreshment 1 study till late in the night. 116. But did this doctor
speak the truthl Gi. Yes, the very truth3 foras Ι was once coming
home from church, 6 3661166166 that bore me company told metha

doctor dwelt there; Ihad 6 mind to 666 his quarters, so Ι knocked 61

the door, and in Ι went. Iremember it was on a Sunday ; I found the

doctor, his 666, and servant 61 dinner. ; the bill 61 1616 was 6 couple 61
6336, and nothing 61 all 6166 Jo. Why, sure they must be 16616 skele·
tons. Gi. No; really they were both plump and in good liking, fresh
coloured, their eyes brisk and lively. 116. 1666 scaros believe it Gi.
11611 366 nothing but what Ι know to be true. Nay, he is not the 6613

m'an that lives after this manner, but many others, men 61 16611166 and
substance in the world, do thc same. Take my word ior it, much eat·

ing 6611 drinking is rather. 66 effect 6166616111 1116611161 61 nature Il

a person accustom himself by little and little, he may come in time to

do as much as Milo-to eat up an ox in a day’s¹ time. Jo. Good God!
if itbe possible 1616 1666 16 preserve his health with so little susten-
ance, what a 31661 deal 61 unneoessary expense are the Germana,

English, Danas, and Poles at upon their bellicsl Gt. A great deal
without doubt, and that to the apparent prejudice 61 their health and
understanding.

Ja. But what is the matter that you could not content yoursell'
with that way of livingi Gi. Because Ι had accustomed myself to

another manner, aad it was too late to alter my way 61 living 111611
