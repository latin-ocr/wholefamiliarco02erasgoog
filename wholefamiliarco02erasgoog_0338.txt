them into your garment or leave them in your pocket, that when you ,
send your clothes to the tailor to mend he may find them, and he will·
make no secret of it ; and when you come to the knowledge of it, put
an air of vexation and displeasure on your countenance, as il you were
heartily vexed you were so careless as to leave them there. Ha. Ι
have practised that so long that I can as easily change my countenance
as Ι ean my dress. Ne. By this means the deceit will nothe dis·
covered, and the matter will be blazed abroad. Ha. I will be sure to
take great care of that.

N e. Then you must furnish yourself with companions, or servants,l
who shall stand cap in hand to you, and call you my young lord at(¹
every turn. You need not be discouraged at the charge, there are a}

reat many young men who will act this part for nothing, or scr thel

humour's sake. And besides, there are a great many scribbling blades
in this country that are strangely insected with the itch (I was going
to say the acab) of writing3 and there are hungry printcm that will
venture at anything, if there be but any hope of getting money. You
must bribe some of these to give you in their pamphlets the title os a
nobleman of your country, and let it bs repeated every now and then
in capital letters. Thus they will celebrate you a nobleman in
Bohemia3 and oue book spreads more than a hundred talkative,

but there will be servants to be maintained Ne. There will so, but
then you must not keep idle servants that have no hands, they will be -
unprolitable. Yon must send one one way, end another another, and,
so they will lay their fingere on something cr other, they will have ·

them. Na Unless you are an expett gamester at cards and dice, a Ἰ
rank whoremuster, a stout drinker, a during extravagantem under· : -
stand the ait of borrowing and bubbling, and have got the French l

Ha. A very little oue. Ne. Well, but when you are once settled in
the reputation of a grem man you will easily find lools that will give
you credit; some will be ashamed, and others afraid to deny you, and
there are a thousand ways to delude creditore. Ha. Iam not uu-
acquainted with them. But they will be very pressing when they
find nothing coming but words. Ne. N ay, on the contrary, no man ''
has his creditore more at command than he that oues money to a gieat
many. Ilo. How sol Ne. First of all, your creditor pays you that ἰ
observance as if he was the person obliged, and is afraid lest he
should give any occasion of losing his money. No man has his l
servants so much in awe as the debtor his creditor; and if you ever ἰ
pay them anything, it is more kindly taken than if you gave it them. ¹
Ha I have found it so.

will make a great noise for a small matter ; those that have amore Η
plentiful fortune are more easy to be appeased; they will be restrained
