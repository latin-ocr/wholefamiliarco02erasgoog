THE RELIGIOUS Praemissus. 253

shown 16 everybodyt Oy. No, certainly, my good friend. Me. How
' then did you come to have such credit with them, 11161 116116 61 their
secrete were concealed from youl 09. Ι had some acquaintance with
the reverend prolate, William warham, the archbiahop‚ and 1161666111-
mended me. Me. Ι have heard he was 6 man 61 great humanity.
09. Nay, if you knew the man, you would take him for humanity
itself He was a man of that learning, that candour 61 manners, and
that piety of life, that there was nothing wanting in him to make him
6 most accomplished prelate.

From hence we were conducted up higher; for behind the high
altar there is another secentas into another church. In 6 certain

new chapel there was shown to 116 the whole face of the good man set .

in gold, and adorned with jewele; and here 6 certain unexpected
chance had near interrupted all our felicity. Me. Iwant sadly to
hear what mischievous matter this was. 09. My friend Gratian lost
himself here extremely. After a short prayer, he says to the assistant
61 him that shewed us the relies, Good father, is it true, as Ι have
heard, that Thomas, while he lived, was very charitable 16 the poorl
Very true, replica he, and began to relate a great many instances 61
his charity. Thon, anawers Gratian, I do not believe that good in·
clination in him is changed, unless it be for the better. The officer
aasented Then, says he again, if this holy man was ao liberal to the
poor when he was a poor man himself, and stood in need of charity
for the support of his own body, do you not think he would take it
well now, when he ie grown so rich and wenta nothing, if some poor
woman having a family of children 61 home ready to aterve, or
daughters in danger of being under a necessity to prostituta themselves
for want 61 portione, or a husband aick in bed, and destitute 61 ,all
comforts 3 if euch a woman should ask him leave 16 make bold with
some small portion of these vast riches for the relies 61 her family,
taking it either as by consent, 61 by gift, or by way of borrowingl

The assistant making no answer to this, Gratian beinga warni
man, Ι 6111 fully persuaded, says he, 11161 the good man would be glad
61 his ’66611111611111611116 is dead he could be able to relieve the
necessities 61 the poor with his wealth. Upon this the shower of 1116
relics began 16 frown, and to pont out his lips, and 16 look upon 11666
if he would have eaten us up ; and I do not doubt but he would have
spit in our 16666, and have turned us out 61 1116 church by the neck
and shoulders, but that we had the archbiehop’s recommendation.
Indead I did in some measure pacisy him with good words, telling him
that Gratian did not speak this from his heart, but had a droll way
with him, and 6166 laid down a little money.

Me. Indeed, I exoeedingly approve 61 your piety. ButI some-
times seriodsly think 61 it, how they ean possibly excuse themselves
from being guilty 61 6 fault who consume such vast suma in building,
beautifying‚ and enriching churches, setting no bound to their ex·
penses. I allow that there ought to be a dignity in the sacred vestments,
1116 vessels 61 6 church, agreeable to the solemn service, and would
have the structure 61 11 16 have a certain air of majesty ; but 1ο what
purpose are ao many golden fonte, so many eandlesticka, and so many
imagesl To what purpose ie auch a profusion of expense upon organa,
