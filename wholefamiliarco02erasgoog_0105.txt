of an honest and useful citizen and an uncorrupted magistrate, and
that he should leave to posterity monuments of his virtue snd industry.
And what could be spoken more divinely than this, “I depart as from
an inu, and not an habitation.'' Sc long wc may stay in an inn till the
host bids us be gone, but a man will not easily be forced from his own
house. And yet from hence the fall of the house, or lire, or some
accident drives us. Or if nothing of these happen, the structure falls
to pisces with old age, thereby admonishing us that we must change
our narters.

qNepte. That expression of Socrates in Plato is not less elegant:
“ Methiulrs‚” says he, “ the sonl of a man ia in the body as in a garri-
son; there is no quitting of it without the leave of the generals, nor no
stsying any longor in it than during the pleasurc of him that placed
him therc.'’ This allusion of Plato's of agarrison instead of a house
is the more significant of the two. For in a house is only implied
abedo, in a garrison we are appointed to some duty by our governor.
And much to the same purpose is it that in Holy Writ the life of man
is sometimes called a warfare, and at other times a racc.

Eu. But Cato’s speech, methinlrs, seems to agree very well with
that of St. Paul, who, writing to tho Corinthiam, calls that heavenly
mansion which we look for after this life in one place (111111, a house,
in another trancriptum mansion, and moreover (besides that) hc calls
the body σκῆνος, a tabernacle. “ For we also,'’ says he, “who are in
the tabernaclo grean, being burdensd.'’

Nepla Much atter this manner says St. Peter: “AndI think it
meet,'' says he, “as long as Iam in this tabernaclo, to stir you up by
putting you in mind, being assured that I shall shortly put off this
tabernacle.'' And what else does Christ himself say to ns, but that
we should live and watch as if wawere presently to die ; and so apply
ourselves to honest things, as if we were to live for everi And when
we hearthcse excellent words of Cato, “Oh,that glorious day,” do we not
seem to hear St Paul himself saying‚ “I desire to be dissolvcd, and to
he with Christ 1” How happy are they that wait for death with such a
1111111 of mind! But as for Cato's speech, although it be an excellent
ono, methinlrs there is more boldncss and arrogance in it than becomes
aChristian. Indead, 1 never read anything in a heathen that comes

⁴ nearer to a Christian than what Socrates said to Crito a little before he

dranlr his poison: ‘¹ Whether Ι shall bo approved or not in the sight
of God I cannot tell 3 but this I am certain of, that I have most affec-
tionately endeavoured to plesse Him3 and 1 have a good hope that He
will accept of my endeavours.'’ This great man was diffident of his
own performsnces5 but so that being consciens to himself of the pro
pensity of his inclination to obey the divine will, he conceived a good
hope that God, of His goodness, would accept him for the honesty of
his intentione. Indead, it was a wonderful elevatiora of mind in a man
that knew not Christ, nor the Holy Scripturas. And, therefore, Ι can
scaree forbear when I read such things of such men, but cry out,
“Soocts Socrates, ora pro 111111, Saint Socrates, pray for us.'' 01.
