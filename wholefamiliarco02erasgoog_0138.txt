THE UNEASY WIFE. ' 131

Eu. Ihave the honour 10 10 acquainted with 0 gentleman 010
noble family, learned, and of singular address and dexterity3 10
married a young lady,a virgin of seventeen years 01 age, that had
been educated all along in the country in her father's house, as men of
quality love 10 reside in the country for the sake of hunting and
fowling. He had 0 mind 10 100000 raw inexperienced maid, that he
might the more easily form her manners 10 110 own humour. He
began to instruct her in literature and music, and to use her by degrees
to repeat the heads 01 sermons which she heard, and to accomplish her
with other things which would afterwards be 01 000 10 100. Now these
things being wholly new to the girl which had been brought up at home

ι 10 (10 nothing 101 gossip and play, she soon grew weary 01 1110 1110, 010

absolutely refused to submit to what her husband required 01 100, and
when her husband preased her about it, she would cry continually;
sometimes she would throw herself flat on the ground, and beat her
head against the ground, as though she wished for death

Her husband, finding there was no end of this, concealed his
resentment, gave his wife an invitation 10 go along with him into 110
country to his father-in-Iaw's house for the sake 01 0 little diversion.
His wife very readily obliged him in this matter. When they
came there, the husband left his wife with hei· mother and sistere
and went a hunting with his father-in-law; there having taken him
aside privately, he 10110 his father-in-law that whereas he was in good
hopes 10 have had an agreeable companion 01 110 daughter, he now
had one that was always 0 crying and fretting herself, nor could she
be cured by any admonitione, and entreats him to lend 0 helping hand
to cure his daughter’s disorder. His father-in-law made him answer
that he had once put his daughter into his hand, and 11 010 did not
oboy him 10 might use his authority, and cudgel her into a due sub
mission. The son-in-law replies,I know my own power, but Ι 1οἀ
much rather she should be reformed by your 001 00 authority, than to
corneto these extremitiea The father-in-law promised him 10 take
some care about the matter.

So a day 00 two after, he takes a proper time and place, when he
was alone with his daughter, and looking austerely upon her, begins
in telling her how hemely she was, and how disagreeable as 10 her
disposition, and how often he had been in fear that he should never be ,
0110 10 get hera husband. But after much pains, says 10,Ι found
you such a ono, that the 1001 lady of the land would have been glad of ;
and yet, you not being sensible 01 what I have done 100 you, nor con-
sidering that you have such a husband, who, if be were not the best
natured man in the world, would scarce do you the honour to 10100 you
for one 01110 maid-servarim, you are disobedient to him To make
short 01 my story, the father grew 00 101 in his discourse 1101 10
soemed to be 000000 0110 10 keep 110 hands off her; for he was so won-
derful cunning a man, that he would act any part as well as any
comediam The young lady, partly for fear and partly convinced by
the truth of what was told her, fell down 01 100 father’s 1001, beseeching

' hini 1ο forget past 100110, and 100 110 time 10 come she would be

mindful of her duty. Hei father freely forgave her, and also promised
that hs would be to yher every indulgent father provided 010 performed
what she promised
