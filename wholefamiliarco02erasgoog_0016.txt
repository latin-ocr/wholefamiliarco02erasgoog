to any, what 01101100 say 01 1110000110 go to Jerusalem through so
many dangers, 001 01 ιο great expense, out of England arrd Seotland,
and especially leaving their nearest 001 1001001 relations at home, 01
whom, according 10 the doctrine 01 the apostle, they ought to bave a
continual 00101 st. J erome proclaims aloud, that it is no great matter
to have been at Jerusalem, but it is a great thing 10 have lived well.
And yet it is probable that in J erome's time there were more eviderrt
100101000 01 ancient 000000010 10 be 0000 than now. As 101110 110-
0010 concerning 1000, I leave that to others. This Colloquy only
treats that 0000 should raahly take such 1000 upon them. That this
is 1100, these words 01 0100 plainly shew : Especially Ι having a wife
0111000, 0000110 the 11000101 1101 age, children, and 0 family which
depended 0000 00, 001 0010 maintained by my daily labour; and
ether words that follow. ’1110101010 Ι 0111 000 nothing 01 1000 that
010 0010, only this, that if Ι were 0000 100011 001 unwillingly dis·
charge those that had bound themselves from them. In undertaking
them, as 1 grant that itis possible for some one to go to Jerusalem with
an advantage 10 01010, 00 Ι should make 00 00100101100 many eircum-
stanees 01 things 10 advise that they would lay out the expensas, time,
and 00100 10 other purposes, which would more immediately eonduce
10 11110 piety. 1 judge these 10 be pious things, and for that reason,
considering either 1110 inconstaney, or ignoranee, 01 superstition 01 .
many, 1 have thought it proper 10 give youth warniug 01 11101 thing 3
and I do 001 000 whom this admonition ought to offend, 001000 perhaps
such persons te whom gain is preferable to godliness Nor do Ι 111010
condemn the pope's indulgenees or perdens, but that most vain trifler
who put all his hope 10 men's 0011000, without the least thought 01
amending his life. 11 any ene shall seriously consider with me how
great a destruction 01 01010 011000 among men, partly by their sicea,
0110 prostituta the pepe's indulgenccs, and partly by 1110 10011 01 them
who take them otherwise than they ought 10 10, he will confess that it
is worth the while 10 01000101] young 1000 01 this matter. But some
may say, by this means the commissionem 1000 111011 gain. Hear me,
0 honest man! if they are good rnen they will rejoice that the simple
010 thus admonished 3 but if they are such as 010101 gain before 00111-
ness, fare them well. ·

In the Colloquy concerning Hunting after Benefiees‚ I blame those
who frequently 100 10 Rome and hunt after beneficas, 0110011000 with
the corrupting their manners and loss 01 their money; and fer 11101
reason I carry on my discourse, that a priest should delight himself in
reading good authors instead 01 0 concubine.

In the Soldier’s confession I tax the villanies 01 00111010 and their
wicked 00010εο1000, that young men may detest such manners.

and manners becoming his age.

In the Youth's Piety, do Ι 00110101011 0 childish mind with godly
precepta 101 the study 01 010101 As 101 11101 which some have snarled
01 0000010100 0001000100, 11 10 0 mere ealumny, to which I have answered
long ago. Ι 100011 that confession 10 10 be performed just as it was
0110100110100 by Christ, but whether it be 00 1000 Ι have neither a
