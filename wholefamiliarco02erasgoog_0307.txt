ing 10 trouble more people when he went 00101 the world than he did
when 110 came into it.

Mo. I want to hear this story out. Pla. You shall 11001 11
presently. Thursday came, and finding himself extremely wealr, 110
kept his bed. The parish priest being then called, gave him the extreme
unction, and again the sacrament; but he made no confession, for he
said he had 00 00101110 upon his mind. The parson then began 10 talk
to him about his burial, with what pomp and in what 111000 he would
be buried. Bury' me, says he, as you would bury the meanest Chris-
tian; nor do I concern myself where you lay this worthless body 01
10100-11 will be found all 000011110 day 01 judgment wheresoever you
lay it ; and as 10 the pomp 01 my funeral, 1 matter it not. When he

came 10 mention the ringing of bells and saying massas (tricenary and ,

anniversary), pardons, and purchasing a communion 01 1001110, 110
10111101, My good pastor, 1 shall find mysclf never the worse if 00 bell
be rung 01 all ; 11 you will afford me but ene funeral office it will
abundantly content me, hut if 111010 he anything 0100 that the publio
custom 01 the church has made necessary, aad that cannot well be
omitted without scandal 10 the weak,I leave that 10 your 1110001110.
Nor arn I at 011 (10011000 10 buy any man’s prayers or rob any man 01 his
merits; there is merit enough in Christ, and 10 spara ; and 1 trust that
Imyself shall be the better 101 the prayers and merits 01 the whole
church, ifl be but a living member of it. My whole hope is in these
two assurances: the 0110 is, 11101 1110 Lord J esus, the chief Shephcrd,
hath taken all my 01110 upon Him, nailing them 10 Η10 01000 ; 1110
01110110, that which Christ Himself hath signed and scaled with His
own hely blood, 11111011· gives us assurauee 01 0101001 001101100 11 110
place 011 0111 11001 10 Him. Far be 1111010 1110 10 100101 upon being
urnished with merite and pardons, and provehe my (sod 10 enter into
judgment with His servant, in whose sight no flesh living shall be jus-
tified; because His mercy is boundless and anspeakable, to it 1 appeal
from His justice.

The parson hearing this went away3 and Cornelius, with great

joy and cheerfulness (as one transported with the hope 01 0 better 1110), -

caused 00010 texts 10 be read 00101 the Holy Scripturas, that confirm
the hope 01 the resurrection and set before him the rcwards 01 immor-
· tality ; 00 that 00101 Isaiah, concerning the death 01 Hezekiah, together
with the hymn ; and then the 1111000111 chapter of the First Epistle of
Paul to the Corinthians, 1110 death of Lazarus out 01 John, but espo-
cially the history 01 Christ's passion 001011110 Gospels. But, 011, with
what affection did he take in all these scripturas, sighing 01 00010
passages, folding his hands, 00 10 110011010000, 01 others; one while
rapt and overjoyed at some passages, aud another time sending up short
ejaculations. After dinuer, having taken 0 111110 rest, he ordered the
twelfth chapter 01 St. John to be read to the end 01 the story. Here you
would have said the 01001100 transfigured and possessodwith anewspirit

When it grew towards evening he called 101 his wife and children,
and raising himself 00 well as he could, he thus bespake them: My
11001 wile, the 00100 God 11101 0000 joined 00 together doth now part us,
