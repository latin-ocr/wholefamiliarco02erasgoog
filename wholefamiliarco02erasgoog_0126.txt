THE VIRGIN Avensa TO MATRIMONY. ὶ119

for myself. Ma Well, Ι will keep them for you. But there is
another reason why Ι dare not give you a kiss as things are at present.
Pa. What is thatl Ma. You say your soul isgone out oi your body
into mine, so that there is but very little left. ·I am afraid that in
kissing the little that is left in you should jumpout of you into rue,
and so you should be quite dead. Shake hands as apledge of my love,
and so farewall. Do you see that you manage the matter vigorously,
and I will pray to God in the meantime that whatsoever be done may
be for both our good.

THE VIRGIN AVERSE TO MA TRIMONY.

Eubulus, Gotberina

Eu. Ι am glad, with all my heart, that supper is over at last, that
we may have an opportunity to take a walk, which is the greatest
diversion in the world. Uo. And I was quite tired of sitting so long
at table. Eu. How green and charming does everything in the world
look, surely this is its youthl Ca. Ay, so it is. Eu. But why is it
not spring with you tool Co. What do you meant Eu. Because
you look a little dull. Oa. Why, don’t I loolr as Ι used to, dol Eu.
Shall I shew you how you lookl Co. With all my beart. Eu. Do
you sce this rose, how it contracta itseli now towards nightl oa.
Yes, I do see it. And what thenl Eu. Why, just so you look.
Ca. A very fine oomparison. Eu. If you will not believe me, see
your own face in this fountain here.

What was the meaning you sat sighing at supper sol Oa Pray,

But it does very much concern me, since I cannot be oheerful myself
without you be so too, See, now, there is another sigh, aud a deep
one too. Oa. Tharais, indeed, something that troubles my mind, but
1 must not tell it. Eu. What, will you not tell it me, that love you
more dearly than 1 do my own sister. My Katy, don’t be afraid to
rpeak, be it what it will, you are sal. Ca. If I should bo safe

word, or 1 will never let you alone till I have it out Co. Well, then,

I do 've you my word.
· hb. Upon the whole of the matter, 1 cannot imagine what you
should wantos being completely happy. Oa. I would 1 were so.
aa. Yon arsin the very flower of your age. If Ι am not mistalren,
you are now in your serenteenth year. Ca That is true. Ita So
that, in nry opinion, the sear ol old age cannot yet be any part of your
trouble Oa Nothing less, 1 assius you. Eo. And you are every
way lorely, and that is the singular gift oi God. Co. Of my person,
such as it is,I neither glory nor complain. Eu. And besides, the
babit of your body and your complexion bespeak you to bo in perfect
