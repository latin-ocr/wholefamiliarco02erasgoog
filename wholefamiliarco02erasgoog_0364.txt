Therefore, the Holy Spirit deeigning to siguify to us a singular favour
toward the hely Virgin, thus expresses it by her own mouth, Quia
'respexit ud humilitatem αηοίιὶω suc. He turns away his eyes from
those that are lifted up, and great in their own opinions, aud fixos
them upon her who is very low iu her own eyes. Nor is it ιο be
’ doubted but there werec grem many learned, mighty, rich, and
noble persons who hoped for the Messiah to come ef their stock 5
but, God despising thern, turned the eyes cf His most mercisul favour
upon a virgin of an obscure character, mean in the world, married to a
carpentar, and not enriched with any offspring.

That was the sycophant's own word, and none of Erasmus’s. Le. But
perhaps he uses the word vilitas in the annotations. Hi. N ο ; not at

thus, Ut intelligas parvitatem, non animi virtutem ,· sitque sensus, etaiam

Greek word ταπεινοφροσύνῃ seems to express something more than
