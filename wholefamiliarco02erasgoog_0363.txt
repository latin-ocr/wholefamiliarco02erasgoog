³56 FAMILIAR consocians,

especially such as are gone to heaven, it would be blasphemy. m.

You have made out the matter finely; then, if Erasmus has said that
the adorable Virgin was a vile haudmaid of the Lord¹s, there is nobody
but would say this was impiously spoken. But inasmuch as she speaks
of herself after that manner, it is for her glory, and furnishes us with
an example of modesty; because as whatsoever we are, we are by the
grace of eod, so the greater any person is, the more humbly he ought
tc behave himself.

Le. lagree with you sofar. But those persons when they say
they correct, intend ιο corrupt or falsify. But then we ought to see
whether the word vilitas answers ιο the Greek word that Lukc
made use of. Hi. For that very purpose Ι made haste from the scr·
mon to consult the text Le. Pray, let me hear what you gathcred
thence. lli. The words which Luke, by the inspiration of the Holy
spirit, writ with his holy fingens, are thus, ὅτι {sedlerter ieri την
ταπείνωσιν τε δούλους ἆυτυῦ; 0111 Erasmus has translated, Qun respersit
ad humilitatem ariciilee suoe. He only adds the proposition, which Luke
himself did not leave out; which is no inelegant Latin, nor is super·
flaons ns to the sense. Terence in Phormio speaks in the same form,
Respice ad me. But in the annotatione we find Luke rather said,
aspice ad me, than respice ad me. Le. Why, then, is there any differ-
ence between respicere aud aspiceret Hi. Not very much ; but there
is some. He respicit, who, turning his head, looks at those things that
are behind him ; he aspicit, who simply looks upon. As in Terence,
Phaedra looks upon Thais coming out of doors, saying, Totus, Parmeno,
trerw donesque postquam asperi loric, But the brother Chserea speaks
thus, 0110111110 respicio ad cirpireem,· for he had turned himself toward
the old man, and when he had done, turned his body back again to the
maid. But yet sometimes respicere is used for to have regard to, or
care of anything, either coming on us, or that is present. So the
satirist uses it·-

Respioere extreme jussit spatie ultima vitre.

For death follows us as pressiug upon our hacke, at which we look back
ae often as wo think of it. And Terence says, Respice seriectutcm 0110111.
Therefore, he that being intent upon anything else, does not take care
of his children‚is said reon respicere stoa· and on the other hand, he
that throving off other cares, turns his thoughts this way, is very
elegantly said respicere. But God at one view sees all things past,
present, and to come; but yet in the holy scripturos he speaks to ns
after the manner of ,men He is said cessari those whom He rejects,
respicere those whom He bestows His favour upon, after having seemed
toneglect them for some time. But Luke had expressed this more
fully, if he had said entitatem now we read it ἐπέέλεψεν ,· but read
which you will, the sense is much the sama Lr.=But then the pre-
position repeated seems to be superfluous.

Hi. lt is certain the Latius speak in this maurenascae ud me
oppetit animam ad scriberrdum. I do not think the proposition ia
superfluous in this sentence ; for he may be said respicere who happens
ιο look back, directing his sight to no particular object; but when it is
expressed respexit od me, thereis a peculiar favour of the person's being
