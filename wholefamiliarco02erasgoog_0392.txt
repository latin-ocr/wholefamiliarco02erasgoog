THE SERAPHIC FUNERAL. 385

our age who will hare it thet a man 10 justified only by faith, without
the help 01 good works3 but 1110 the greatest privilege in the world to
be saved by a garment without faith Tb. Do not mistake me, Phila-
cous3 1 do not say simply without faith, but with this faith 01 101101-
ing, that the things I have told you were promised by our Saviour 10
the patriarch St Francis. Pb. But will this garment 0010 a Turkl
111. lt would 0010 the devil himself if he would but suffer it 10 bs put
on him, and could but believe this revelation. Pb. Well, thou hast
won me for ever ; but I have ascruple or two more that l would desire
you tc clear up for me. 111. Lat me hear them. Pb. Ι have heard
that st. Francis has said his order was 01 evangelical institution. Tb.
True. Pb. Now, I thought thet all Christiana had professed the rule
01 the gospel ; but if the Franciscans' order be 0 gospcl one, then all
Christiana ought to be Franciscaus, and Christ himself, his apostles, ,
end the Virgin-mothcr at the head 01 them. Tb It would be so,
indeed, unless st. Francis had added some things to the gospel of
Olirist. Pla. What things are theyl Th. An ashcoloured gement,
an hempen girdle, and naked feet. Pl. Well, then, by these marks
we may know an evangelical Christian from a Franciscen, may wel

111. Βο1 they differ too in tha point of touching money. Ph. But,
00 Iam informed, st. Francis forbids the receiving 0111, not the touohing
01 11; but the owner, or the proctor, the creditor, the heir, or the
proxy does commonly receive it ; and though he draws it 0101 with his
glore on, and does not touch it, nevertheless he 10 said 10 receive it.
Whence‚ then, came this new interpretation, that not to receive itis
not 10 touch 111 Th. This was the interpretation 01 pope Benedict
Pa. But not 00 0 pope, but only as a Franciscan. And then, again, do
not the most strict 01 the order take money in a clout, when it is given
them in their pilgrimages 1 Tt. They do in 0 case 01 necessity. Pl.
Buta man should rather die than violate so supererangelical 0 rule.
And then, do they not receive money everywhere by their officarsl
Th. Why should they not, and that thousands and thousands 100, aa
they‘do frequently 1 Pb. But the rulo says, not by themselves nor by
anybody else. ΤΙι. Well, but they do not touch it Pb. Oh, ridicu-
lous 1 11 the touch be impious they touch it by others. 111. Βο1 that
is the 001 and deed of the proctors, not their own. Pb. Is it not 001
Lat him try it that has a mind to it.

Tu. We never read that Christ touched money. Pl. Suppcse
it, though it is very probable that when he was 0 youth he might buy
cil, and vinegar, and salads for his father ; but Peter and Paul, without
011 controversy, touched it. Tha virtue consiste in the contempt 01
money, and notin the non-touching 01 it. Itis much more dangcrous
1ο touch wine than 10 touch money; why are they not afraid os that‘l
111. Because St. Francis did not forbid it. Ph. Do they not readily
11111111 11111111111111111111111111

1000 01 money to look upon and 00011 11 be good, how do they start
110011 and cross themselves! Is not this an evangelical nicetyl In

tmth, I believe st. Francis, 00 illiterata 00 he was, was naver so silly
as 10 have absolutely forbidden all touohing 01 money. And if that
were his opinion, 10 how great a danger did he exposa his followers in
commanding them to go berefootl for it is 000100 possible but that one
