THE FABULOUS BANQUET. 225

' that the pawnbroker had lent money upon his own porridge-pot. Men
are commonly very well pleased with such tricks when they are put
upon such as they have no good opinion 81, especially such as use to
impose upon other persons.

Ad. In truth, by mentioning the name 81 Anthony, you have laid
open 88 88881181 merry stories ; but 1 will tell but one, and a short
one too, 1181 was told 818 very lately. A certain company 81 jolly
follows, who are 181 8 81811 1118 and a merry 888, 88 they 8811 11, were
making merrytogether ; among the rest there wasone Anthonyand
another person, a noted follow 181 88 81811 trick, a second Anthony.
And as it is the custom 81 philosophers, when they meet together, to
propound some questions or other about the things 81 Nature, so in
this company a question was proposed‚——Which was the most honour-
able part 81 8 111881 One said the eyes, another said 1118 18811, another
said the brain, and others said other parts3 and every one alleged some
188888181118888811188. Anthony was bid to speak his mind, and he
gave his opinion 1181 118 mouth was the most honourablo‚ and gave
some reason 18111, I cannot tell what. Upon that the other person,
that he might thwart Anthony, made answer that that was the most
honourable part that we sit upon; and when every ono cried out 11181
was absurd, he backed it with this reason, that he was commonly
accounted the most honourable that was first seated, and that this honour
was commonly done to the part that he spoke 81. They applauded his
opinion, and laughed heartily 81 it. Theman was mightily pleased
with his wit, and Anthony seemed to have the worst 81 it. Anthony
turned the matter off very well, saying he had given the prime honour
to the mouth 181 no other reason but because he knew that tho
other man would name some other part, 11 11 11818 but out 81 envy
to thwart him.

A few days 81181, when they were both invited again toan enter-
tainment, Anthony going in finds his antagonist talking with some
other persons, while supper was getting ready, and turning his arse
towards him, 1818 a great — 1111118 118 1888. 118 being in a violent
passion, says to him, Out‚ you sauoy sellow, where was you dragged up
-et Hogs N ortonl Then says Anthony, What, are you angryl if Ι
had saluted you with my mouth you would have answered mo again;
but now I salute yon with the most honourable part 81 118 body, in
your own opinion, you 8811 188 saucy follow. And so Anthonyregained
the reputation he had lost

We have every one told our 1818; now, Mr. J udge, it is your
business 18 pass sentence. Ge. Well, 1 will do 1181, but not before

been among this merry companyl Po. What should we do but tell

dinner with me. Ge. Yon toll us 818 melancholy entertainment
·indeed. Leo. That will appear. 11 you do not confess that it has
been more entertaining than your fabulous one, I will be content 1ο be
ameroed 8 supper 3 there is nothing more diverting than to 1188181
